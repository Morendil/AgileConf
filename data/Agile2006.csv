If Individuals and Interactions are valued over Process and tools, why is it we have so many books and conference tutorials about process along with so many neat tools to support those well documented processes? The irony doesn't stop there. You'll find Agile books on documenting better user stories, tutorials on writing better customer contracts, and expert guidance on increasing the rate and efficiency of our planning activities.

Yet to be effective, testing must also be a process of investigation - asking challenging questions about the product, and answering them by operating and observing the product. Exploratory testing is a simultaneous process of designing tests, executing them, and learning is key to serving this part of the testing mission. There are many misconceptions about exploratory testing - that it is sloppy, random, unaccountable, or unstructured. (Interestingly, agile processes are sometimes accused of the same things.) This tutorial explains exploratory testing, shows its structure and discipline that may not be apparent to the untrained eye, and engages participants in exercises that give a feel for the process and some experience with it. Since it involves rapid learning, adaptation to new information, and lowered documentation overhead, participants should recognize that exploratory testing is a truly agile process, and should leave the presentation knowing how to do it better.

The existence of a good customer is a primary success factor; and 2. Being a good customer is one of the hardest things to do. The exploration starts small. The two most popular small-team agile methods are eXtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum. Superficially, one would suppose that XP's Customer and Scrum's ProductOwner were ""one and the same"", but closer inspection shows that there are both similarities and differences. By studying these (and other) processes' views of customers, we arrive at a small set of primary responsibilities for the customer: - Determine what the stakeholders want / need from the System; - Prioritize what will actually be developed; - Refine the requirements with the development team; and - Validate that the System delivered is the one agreed upon.

For instance, group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant personalities and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user story estimates made by an agile development team, we investigate whether the introduction of a voting process, derived from Wideband Delphi, improved the estimation ability of the team. The results show that the voting technique improved the team's estimation ability in most cases, but that it increased estimation error in the extreme cases.

Designer stories set the stage for collaborative design. Role stereotypes are useful for assigning or assessing object behaviors. Control styles can help characterize and communicate control center designs. Trust regions can aid in spotting places where defensive programming is needed. Seasoned designers strike a balance. They know the difference between core and revealing design tasks and plan accordingly. When unanticipated difficulties crop, they adapt their work rhythms.

The contract consists of class invariants and method pre- and postconditions. As the code is refactored, specifications of internal units change with the code. There are mutual influences between the code and the contract. The assertions that constitute the contract are Java expressions; refactorings such as Rename Method must change these assertions as well as the code. The contract has methodological implications, which serve as preconditions on some refactorings; these must be checked before performing those refactorings. In addition, some contract modifications follow from certain refactorings, and can be done automatically. Development environments that support design by contract must take these influences into account. We report on the implementation in Eclipse of several refactorings that involve both code and contract. These show how contracts are modified in response to code changes, how contracts prevent certain changes, and how new contracts are computed for newly-generated methods and classes.","Design by contract, refactoring, Eclipse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The case studies applied face-to-face communication to different extent and used email and telephone to manage customer-developer communication inside the development iterations. Our results indicate that increased reliance on less informative iteration time communication channels resulted in higher defect rates.

When looking at our project history, we observed two primary attributes that influenced the type of leadership process used: complexity and uncertainty. Starting from a core set of common practices, the assessment of these complexity and uncertainty attributes enable us to craft a process generally suitable for a given project.

In our work as software development coaches, we have noticed that changing your software development method changes your organisation.

Is the lack of unit testing really the team's biggest problem? We have found that systems thinking is a simple but powerful technique for finding answers to these questions.

We could do that again at agile2006, we believe however, that the content is more memorable and directly appliccable when the participants have (asssisted to) apply it to their work situation. Willem also ran a one hour variant at a clients' location - 15 minutes explaining the diagram of effects, and then 45 minutes applying to the customers' situation.

The proposal focuses on the 180 minutes one, with the 90 minutes one as an alternative.

The long-term view of how to maintain success after your team begins to see that they have achieved the benefits of using agile techniques. Our focus and experience is in commercial product software development. We hope to shed some light on the challenge of keeping agile success going over a long period of time. We have faced the challenge to keep our teams motivated and focused on releases lasting over 18 months; the same product, same people, just new releases.

Every slip and increase has a large impact on total value delivered and we need to start acknowledging this fact. Furthermore, project overruns cause other high-value projects to be delayed or canceled, creating a negative value impact. What is missing in these methods is the concept of financial responsibility. Agile needs a better way to measure total value delivered and Agile methods should be more focused on on-time delivery. To ensure that the development process only generates software that provides the highest value for our customers, we need to schedule, prioritize, and deliver the highest value features without any waste. A research study by Jim Johnson at XP2002 showed that 64% of the features in a typical system are rarely or never used.

It consists of a series of role-playing exercises in which participants struggle to decide what coaching interventions (if any) would be most effective in a variety of situations. In a safe environment, participants can give and receive feedback on their coaching style. The role plays are based on specific scenarios encountered by our Digital Focus coaches as they have worked with new teams adopting agile development.","","Intermediate","This session will be helpful to anyone who finds themselves in a coaching capacity--either formal or informal--for an agile software development team.

Along the way, we encountered significant challenges - from skepticism on the agile approach to coordinating distributed teams to less-than-optimal organizational structures. We learned how to expand agile beyond the development team to advance the relationship between product management; and how to meld the existing engineering practices and business processes we still valued with changes required by our new agile world. Most importantly, we got our first taste of how agile can enhance the value we deliver to our customers.

Before embarking on a distributed project we should evaluate the potential project risks against the financial benefits and determine the best approach to establishing the distributed teams and processes for supporting delivery. On a recent 30 person, multi-site, urgent project we saw a number of serious problems arising from the distribution of our team. The most serious problems we saw were with tacit knowledge, communication and visibility. To combat these we tried a number of techniques including stand-ups, story boards, video documentation, remote desktops, instant messaging, voice-over-ip and continuous integration. We will describe each problem area we faced, and the lessons learned applying each technique to the problem. Conclusion: Despite using these techniques, the impacts of a distributed team out-weighed the financial benefits.

GUIs provide a front-end to the underlying application code that makes software easy to use. Since most of the software development is GUI-centric, testing user interfaces is vital to ensure the system's safety, robustness and usability. Despite the fact that GUI testing is an essential part of software development, most developers don't do test-driven development (TDD) of the user interface because it is complex and error-prone. This hands-on tutorial presents techniques to develop user interfaces using TDD, as well as testing existing user interfaces. The audience will learn how to test Swing GUIs using Abbot and Costello and web user interfaces using Selenium. While the principles for testing rich GUIs are focused on Java, the techniques for testing web user interfaces are applicable to many technologies such as static HTML pages or dynamically generated web user interfaces created in Java, .Net, PHP, etc.","","Intermediate","Developers who want to learn how to learn how to develop GUIs using TDD or simply learn how to test existing GUIs.","Interactive","180","Yes","200+","","","Yes","Developers who want to learn how to learn how to develop GUIs using TDD or simply learn how to test existing GUIs.","","","","","","",""

But, in fact many organizations commonly use the term ""Agile customer"" to refer to the individual or team of people that guide developers by writing user stories, making decisions about development priority, and describing acceptance criteria. The demands of the Agile customer role don't always match up with the skills and availability of actual users of the software. Consequently the role is often filled by someone standing in for the user. On many Agile projects it may be difficult to find and successfully engage a system's actual end-users. But without them, we lose much of the benefit we'd gain from their frequent input and feedback. This discovery session will explore the involvement, successful and otherwise, of actual customers and users in the day-to-day software development process. Participants will learn about: * The range of approaches that can be used to involve customers and users; * Pitfalls common to those approaches; * Possible strategies to avoid those pitfalls. The discovery session will be hands-on, with participants collaborating together in small groups, then sharing and discussing results with all participants.","","Intermediate","","Workshop","90","No","","","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

The starting model is “Autochthony,” a developmental model that shows how cultural aspects (i.e., history, beliefs and intent) combine with organizational/structural aspects (i.e., definition, collaboration and management), and delivery/action-oriented aspects (i.e., process, roles and methods/tools) to define a holistic approach to group advancement. By using, customizing or replacing this model, we hope the workshop will show how these “people patterns” interrelate and support each other with the goal of helping people who design their own future to “learn how to learn” to create it. The model is generic enough to support a complete agile overhaul, introduction of a few new agile practices, or adoption of a specific management technique like Scrum that requires cultural support. The output of the workshop is intended to be a set of “pattern dialects” that address scenarios for improvement in particular environments suggested by the participants.","","Beginner","","Workshop","90","Yes","50","None.","","Yes","","","","","","","",""

The structure of the game encourages a higher level of pair-wise collaboration when compared to traditional pairing. The foundation of the game allows the pair to improve upon the TDD experience by creating an environment in which the two developers compete, in a fun way, to write better tests and better code. In the end, the winner is the customer. What results is always a mystery, but one thing is for sure, the collaboration between the pair encourages a careful negotiation of the scope as both the tests and the implementation are created. In the end, this results in higher quality software and a more collaborative experience when compared with traditional approaches. Use this game to introduce test-driven development and pair programming to your organization. Keep using the game to keep the team engaged and excited to come to work.","","Intermediate","","Combination of Lecture and Interactive","90","No","250","None that we are aware of.

Each would spend just a few moments with the keyboard, writing a test and then passing the keyboard to the other person, challenging them to just as quickly make the test pass. Sometimes they would discuss (read: argue) about whether the scope of the work was too large or too small. This would often lead to modifications in the test. After observing this interaction for a while, Ward asked them what they were doing. The response was ""playing the pairing game!"" Ward saw the underlying value and encouraged them to blog the experience. The original blog post by Peter can be found here: http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2005/08/29/7377.aspx This led Peter and Brad to do the Game in a session at Seattle Code Camp. This was very well received. Out of it came small refinements to the Game. For more information about this session, see http://pacwest.ms/codecamp/sea/1/sessions.html#methodology Peter and Brad continue to play the Game for anyone willing to watch inside of Microsoft. They asked Mitch to join them on their most recent presentation in order to bring a Project Management view to the game.

By offering management the combination of early and continuous delivery of value and the possibility to change their minds along the way, it became possible to get past the problems of a prohibitively large price tag and too long time to market. The report deals with the entire life cycle of the project, including the initial sales pitch, team setup, challenges related to introducing agile development and project execution. Conclusions include that selling agile methodology takes time, needs to be an ongoing activity within an organization, and that it may actually be easier to convince higher management than developers of the virtues of agility.","Sweden, R&D, selling agile, Scrum, Test Driven Development, TDD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At a second level, Ternary appeals to supporting organizations, such as angel investors and law firms with emerging stage practices with the risk minimization inherent in an Agile Process.
