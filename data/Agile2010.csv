5271,"Patterns for customer interaction","When agile practices are introduced in an organization, one of the challenges that can face a development team is to begin meaningful interaction with real customers. Often those of us with technical backgrounds have spent little time studying or appreciating the effort involved in improving our communication skills, especially with those who are not technical. In response to this dilemma, a set of patterns to enhance customer interaction has been written and published and will be presented in this session.","Leadership & Culture","Leadership & Organizations","Invited Tutorial","180 minutes","Ballroom Level","A-2","Monday","August 9th"," 9:00 - 12:30","Linda Rising",,"linda@lindarising.org",,"Introductory"
8589,"Behaviour Driven Development with Cucumber","Cucumber is all the rage these days, but many teams struggle to understand how and when to use it. It is designed to be an Acceptance Testing tool in the context of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), but that explanation tends to bring up even more questions.

Aslak Hellesøy, the author of Cucumber will help you to understand how to use Cucumber effectively. Attendees will learn BDD fundamentals and will develop a small application using Cucumber. They can choose between Java, Ruby and .NET.","Technical Edge-Development Praxis","Technical","Invited Tutorial","180 minutes","Ballroom Level","A-2","Monday","August 9th"," 13:30 - 17:00","Aslak Hellesøy",,"aslak.hellesoy@gmail.com",,"Practicing"
5387,"Dance of the Tester, An Iteration-Length Performance","Ever wonder what a tester does on an agile team? It can be confusing for everyone on the  team trying to understand when there isn't a test phase or any formal documented requirements.

In this tutorial, we follow an agile tester. We start with how testers contribute during release and iteration planning. Then we follow a tester through a typical two-week iteration, from the start through to the end, to see what activities he does and how he adds value. Like a dance, everyone has a role in the finale, so we look at the agile tester's role in a successful release, including the end game.","Testing/Specification Practices","Technical","Invited Tutorial","180 minutes","Lobby Level","Asia 2","Monday","August 9th"," 9:00 - 12:30","Janet Gregory",,"janet_gregory@shaw.ca",,"Introductory"
8603,"Improv: The Mechanics of Collaboration","As businesses delve into Agile practices dysfunctions arise that can not be eliminated using traditional operational processes.  A one-step-at-a-time approach is being replaced by leaps of whatever length necessary.  The complex, rapidly changing market demands are best met by teams for whom shifting paradigms feel like home.
 
A study of improvisational theater is a pertinent supplement to the training of Agile practitioners.

So how do you get started, and how do you keep on improving over time? This session will recommend a three-pronged approach to successful change:    
(1) Get developers personally involved in improving customer outcomes. (We'll cover product champions and Cost Center Disease.)   
(2) Create a script for improvement that generates immediate action. (We'll look at strategy deployment.)  
(3) Rethink the environment (including the governance system).

5990,"Agile's Ultimate Success Lies Outside The Development Team","A sign that Agile has gone mainstream is the expanding discussion of how it affects groups outside the development team. Since Agile seeks to improve both the creation and delivery of value, other groups (marketing, sales, executive management, etc.) are necessarily part of the Agile experiment. However, many Agile teams struggle with these ""downstream"" consequences.

This 180-minute session will take a workshop approach to this topic. Through a combination of discussion and exercises, we will identify, simulate, and address the core issues of Agile's effects beyond the development team.","Business Transformation","Business","Invited Tutorial","180 minutes","Lobby Level","Australia 3","Monday","August 9th"," 13:30 - 17:00","Tom Grant",,"speakersbureau@forrester.com",,"Practicing"

5860,"How We Do Things Around Here In Order to Succeed","The path an Agile roll-out should follow depends on the core culture of the corporation: control, competence, collaboration or cultivation. Irrespective of the specific culture, the Agile roll-out invariably tests cultural integration, wholeness and balance. It exposes inconsistencies between approach to customers versus approach toward other constituencies such as partners and employees. 

To create and capture lasting value, the Agile initiative must be linked to a coherent corporate culture. This workshop holds the details you need to know about how to forge this critical link.

Without leadership, even the best ideas can evaporate into nothingness or ossify into dogmatism. Agile stands at just such a turning point now. The message has become fragmented, diluted, co-opted for profit, mischaracterized, abused, and attached as a label to just about anything.

5928,"The Incentive Trap","In the majority of cases, Agile is introduced into an existing environment. The way in which projects are delivered starts to change, but often the successful realisation of the full benefits of Agile are impeded by causes that are not immediately obvious, or considered material.

In our experience, the manner by which an organisation chooses to reward and incentivise can have unexpected and unintended consequences.

Rather than preaching, or theorising we aim to allow attendees to experience for themselves the end results of different incentive schemes and draw their own conclusions.","Business Transformation","Business","Invited Tutorial","180 minutes","Lobby Level","Asia 4","Monday","August 9th"," 9:00 - 12:30","Simon Bennett","Mark Summers","simon.bennett@emc.com","mark.summers@emc.com","Practicing"

This session is for folks that are already doing Scrum and are curious about Kanban. It will show how the Lean practice of ""One Piece Flow""is the key to both, and look at how to mix and match Scrum and Kanban to fine tune a process that fits your circumstances. This will include: decoupling once-per iteration activities from the iteration, work-in-progress limits, and the concept of ""pull.""

Behavorial Interviewing is a very pragmatic technique that gets to heart of assessing people. Avoid typical mistakes like hiring people similar to you (""fit""). Get good information from people who do not interview well, and don't get blinded by those who do. Focus on the specific traits you need in your team, rather than just skills.

Through experience as interviewers, your team will also greatly enhance their understanding of each other, and collaborate more effectively.","Leadership & Culture","Leadership & Organizations","Tutorial","90 minutes","Ballroom Level","A-2","Wednesday","August 11th"," 15:30-17:00","Rod Belshee","Arlo Belshee","rbelshee@hotmail.com","a+agile2009@arlim.org","Introductory"

Pairs may have trouble agreeing on a direction, or may find that one person has taken over. Yet specific advice about pair programming is hard to find, and we may not even know which skills we lack.

As a group, we'll build a model for thinking about pairing skills. Then we'll suggest some games--constrained formats for short pairing sessions--that can act as intentional practice for these skills.  After trying out a few games together, we'll share our experiences and try to invent some new ones.","Team-Room Agile","Technical","Talk","60 minutes","Lobby Level","Asia 4","Wednesday","August 11th"," 11:00-12:00","Moss Collum","Laura Dean","mcollum@cyrusinnovation.com","lgdean@mit.edu","Practicing"

By simply having people stand up, move around, and speak messages to each other, this workshop will show anyone who attends how advanced object-oriented programming and test-driven design works. 

Although tailored to non-programmers, programmers may find it useful too.

A natural gap between the two is caused by their key interest: change versus stability. 

Introducing Agile in Development confronts Operations with more work due to increased productivity and release frequencies. The power of Agile is not unleashed.

1. Understand challenges and goals  
2. Understand the environment and technical practices  
3. Decide what techniques (Scrum, Kanban, collocation, etc) might be suitable  
4. Build a plan with them of what a transition to Agile might look like

Participants will use physical materials which are typically not thought of as part of the business setting - a.k.a. ""junk.""  This session will be divided 4 segments:  
1) Creating prototypes in small groups  
2) Reflecting on the prototypes, their purpose(s) and the assumptions behind them  
3) Revising prototypes based on the reflection 
4) Finally, we'll summarize what we've learned, and how to incorporate this exercise or similar ones into the work of Agile teams.","UX/UI","Technical","Workshop","90 minutes","Ballroom Level","E-4","Thursday","August 12th","15:30-17:00","Nancy Frishberg",,"nancyf@fishbird.com",,"Practicing"
5296,"Lean in a Nutshell","Join Mary Poppendieck for a Lean in a Nutshell - a fast-paced talk aimed at senior developers and team leads. The lecture and discussion will focus on framing the software development process; it will cover four key frames that really make a difference when you are developing software: (1) A systems view, (2) Essential technical capability, (3) What it takes to deliver reliably, and (4) How to improve.

5328,"Refactor Your Retrospectives","Effective retrospectives enable a team to improve iteratively. However, as Agile team leaders and ScrumMasters know from experience, retrospectives can be challenging to facilitate and engage their team in.

Come to this tutorial to find out about retrospective smells to avoid. Learn how you can refactor your retrospectives so they become something the team looks forward to rather than dreads. Embed retrospectives deeper into the way your team works by extending other tried and tested agile practices to your retrospectives.","Building High Performance Teams","Leadership & Organizations","Tutorial","60 minutes","Ballroom Level","Southern Hemisphere II","Thursday","August 12th","11:00-12:00","Rachel Davies",,"rachel@agilexp.com",,"Practicing"
6157,"Products over Process: Successfully Blending Agile Methods and Design Thinking","Several years ago, two agilists (your humble hosts) met and started sharing experiences using agile methods to produce products and their frustrations when ""being Agile"" was more valued than meeting users needs. Our session draws on our shared experiences blending design thinking (e.g. user centered design) and agile methods to discover and deliver meaningful products. We will cover product design, pragmatic personas,  customer discover, story mapping and story telling and more as we teach techniques and share experiences using agility to produce products validated with real user communities.","Business Transformation","Business","Tutorial","90 minutes","Ballroom Level","Southern Hemisphere II","Thursday","August 12th","13:30-15:00","David Hussman","Jeff Patton","david.hussman@devjam.com","jpatton@acm.org","Practicing"
6298,"Understanding Design Complexity","Domain driven design isn't enough to prevent churn on complex, hairy systems. To get slightly ahead of the design curve you should understand more about the inherent complexities in the domain. This tutorial introduces two techniques designers and domain experts can use in conversations to reveal complexities, variations, and stable concepts: commonality-variability analysis and hot spot cards. Applying these techniques allows designers to see the slightly bigger picture so they can be better equipped to align their solutions with the relatively stable parts and support known variations.","Technical Edge-Development Praxis","Technical","Tutorial","90 minutes","Ballroom Level","Southern Hemisphere III","Thursday","August 12th","9:00-10:30","Rebecca Wirfs-Brock",,"rebecca@wirfs-brock.com",,"Practicing"
6177,"Coupling Loosely","Mock objects are a good way to break apart a legacy system to test it. However, they do not improve coupling (few dependencies between units) or cohesion (each unit does one thing). Developers who rely on mocks build well-tested legacy code, even on greenfield projects.

The next step, making the code easy to change, requires using indirections with looser coupling. In this information-dense, code-oriented session, we'll learn 12 to 18 key indirections and their impacts on your design. Next time, choose the right indirection for the job rather than just reaching for another mock object.","Technical Edge-Development Praxis","Technical","Talk","90 minutes","Ballroom Level","Southern Hemisphere III","Thursday","August 12th","13:30-15:00","Arlo Belshee",,"a+agile2009@arlim.org",,"Expert"
6181,"Telling Your Exploratory Story","Exploratory testing is an approach emphasizing freedom and creativity. For projects that use Agile values and principles, there are two areas where exploration might be particularly useful -- story creation and feature integration. The first may involve a brainstorm using heuristics that trigger ideas about structure, functions, data, platform, operations, and time (to name a few). Feature integration can benefit from chartered, time-boxed sessions where structured exploration exposes new risks and vulnerabilities. This talk is about methods to describe the thoughtful testing of those stories.","Testing/Specification Practices","Technical","Talk","90 minutes","Ballroom Level","Southern Hemisphere III","Thursday","August 12th","15:30-17:00","Jon Bach",,"jonb@quardev.com",,"Practicing"
