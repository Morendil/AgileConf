"12812","Align your scrum teams with ad-hoc personas","Delivering value to the customer is at the core of Agile. But with rapid iterations and little time for research how do you ensure that your teams are building products for the **same** customer?     

One lightweight technique that helps companies align around a common vision of the customer is the **ad-hoc persona**. This technique visually articulates the team's shared belief of who the customer is (as opposed to a heavily researched and costly persona creation effort) and what motivates them to use the company's products. 

This workshop will teach why ad-hoc personas are powerful, how to create them and how to use them to align scrum teams for deeper customer understanding, group story writing and customer feedback validation.

"13252","Agile Values, Innovation and ( the Shortage of Women Software Developers","Women are opting out of software development and leaving established software careers in disproportionate numbers. This is a material burden to the software industry and contributes to software that under-serves women as end users.



Agile principles motivate practitioners to drive change into their organizations that support a humane, collaborative, empowered way of working. Organizations embracing these principles have potential to better attract and retain women (and men). 



As Agile practitioners should we and can we advocate for this outcome?



Women represent 46% of the workplace and only 25% of software developers. Over two decades the percentage of women developers has steadily declined. 41% of women professionals leave established careers in high technology. Half leaving the sector completely. The number of women earning Computer Science bachelor s degrees dropped 55% from 1986 to 1995 despite growing percentages of women graduating from four year colleges. And young women are significantly less interested in studying hard tech then men.



Their absence costs the software industry and is an impediment to addressing a market where women are online in equal numbers to men; directly or indirectly influence 61% of consumer electronics purchases; generate 58% of online dollars; and represent 42% of  active gamers. 

Women avoid careers in software development due to hostile environments, unsustainable pace, diminished purpose, disadvantages in pay, advancement, peers and mentors. 



Agile values steel practitioners for the hard work of confronting impediments, incrementally nudging an organization towards a more collegial, sustainable, creative and productive workplace so that the organization can repeatedly create software of value to stakeholders and of real use to people. These principles and the emergent properties they instill in organizations fight many of the dysfunctions research indicates contribute to women's flight from and avoidance of software careers.



Through iterative cycles of knowledge creation and sharing within companies, across enterprises, into academic institutions and out to the media success within development teams can shift the larger culture. Agile adoption itself is an example of this.



The result could be more human workplaces and a more social and engaged view of the software developer that will encourage girls to pursue computer science and help the industry recruit and retain larger numbers of talented women.

"13283","Can Marketing Go Agile?","Perforce adopted Agile processes several years ago for Engineering. A mix of Scrum and Kanban techniques are in use and are widely seen as having delivered real improvements.



Several managers at Perforce saw this success and wanted to reap some of the same benefits in other departments. In 2011 Perforce extended Agile processes to Marketing. Coaches were brought in and a Scrum pattern was quickly established.



A year into the experiment, Marketing has seen visible improvements in transparency and collaboration. As might be expected, much work remains to be done. The eventual goal is similar to DevOps: Agile teams and processes in each department with cross-department collaboration. As we get closer to that goal, all the parts of the company will be more closely aligned and pulling in the same direction to help the business.



This presentation will describe the initial transition to Agile, including all the pitfalls and growing pains.  Just adopting the basic structure of Scrum (e.g. daily standup meetings) helped improve team communication and made management more aware of the work being done.  But Marketing is a truly cross-functional team with schedules heavily driven by external events and other departments, with remote workers and a partner team in the UK.  Some of the questions we encountered early on were:



* What really constitutes a team?  We all report to the same manager, but technical marketing, corporate marketing, and outreach all have very different tasks and goals.

* Our sprints are heavily schedule driven: Engineering schedules and conference dates dominate our planning.  That feels a lot like waterfall project management.

* The whiteboard is now project management system #5.  What works well inside the office doesn't work well for the folks in London or working remotely.  How do we manage our communication?



The current state of Agile in Marketing will come next, followed by our vision for 2012.  Ideally, Marketing becomes more closely aligned with Engineering.  We're looking at the right way to handle that, including options like 'scrum of scrums' or aligning scrum teams around projects instead of departments, while being aware of the dangers of rocking the boat too much.



We d like to share our experiences to help others avoid some of the challenges we faced, and hopefully learn from the community about how to drive forward.  We haven't solved all the challenges yet, but we've made progress.



This brief presentation will be relevant to development team leads, product managers, technical marketers, marketing managers, IT: those interested in implementing Agile practices in non-Engineering departments for intra- and inter- department productivity gains.","30 Min Accept (Insights/Research only - One Option Only)","Insights - Experience Reports","Lecture","30 minutes","Ft.

Last year's talk provided a broad brush on a number of topics to introduce how we can consider security throughout the agile development life cycle.



This talk will go in-depth on a vital component of identifying, capturing and ranking potential vulnerabilities in software system:  the concept of Abuser Stories.  



Abuser stories is a way to capture potential vulnerabilities in software systems, using the standard user story format.  While user stories are written from a user perspective, abuser stories are written from an enemy or attacker's perspective and describe the enemy's mal-intent and motivation.



The session will look at the concept of Abuser Stories more in-depth. We will examine:

�%	How seemingly benign functional user stories can create vulnerabilities in our software, leaving lots of opportunity for our enemies to take advantage of our weaknesses.   

�%	How to use the concept of abuser stories to shed some light on where these vulnerabilities can be introduced.   

�%	How to craft a good abuser story.    

�%	How to craft refutation criteria so that we can determine that the attack depicted by the abuser story is not possible.    

�%	How to estimate and rank abuser stories.

"13424","Lightweight Security in Agile Enterprise Environments: Introducing Threat Modeling Express","You care about security, but common secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices such as traditional threat modeling and secure requirements analysis seem to be geared towards Waterfall development. What can you do? In this session we will explain the concept of Threat Modeling Express and model one of the audience member's actual applications, live, together. Threat Modeling Express is a two hour activity you do once a quarter that helps you put the right security requirements in your backlog (or other ticket/story/requirements management repository).  It's extremely lightweight: you need a developer (yourself), somebody with security knowledge (possibly another developer), and somebody who represents business priorities (a product owner?). Together in a room you hash out the most common user stories/use cases, possible malicious intents, technical means to achieve those intents, group risk rating, and adding countermeasures to your backlog. At the end of the session you have group buy-in on the security risks you care about and how important they are relative to everything else. This is as lightweight as application security gets: attend if the words ""lightweight"" and ""security"" both appeal to you.

Threat Modeling Express is an alternative to more rigorous / comprehensive design-level security activities such as threat risk assessments, traditional threat modeling, and architectural risk analysis.Threat Modeling Express sacrifices rigor in favor of speed.

Threat Modeling Express is a process defined by Security Compass (an application security consultancy), but is really just describes a set of techniques that companies have been practicing informally for years. It's not proprietary and you can do it on your own without any third party assistance if you have the necessary domain expertise in-house. The speaker is one of the people who coined the term and has taught and used Threat Modeling Express at several large companies primarily in the financial services and utilities industries. 

NOTE: Although the speaker's personal agile experience is with Scrum, the process works equally well in other agile environments.

"13425","There and back again - from iterative to flow... and back to iterative!","Come and hear the story of a team that started with Scrum, transformed their process in a lean-like approach and then were back to iterative. It had a promising start and, just when it feels like the perfect story, things collapsed and the team was taken by a great doom. Fortunately, difficult times and strongly willed people work well together and peace was restored.



The team has started with Scrum, which worked well for a long time. Then, due to context particularities and using retrospectives, the team began to deconstruct Scrum, not by chance but through well thought decisions, and ended up in a single piece continuous flow process. The turning point was when, carried away by the success of removing Scrum practices and ceremonies, the team decided they didn't need a regular retrospective.



Then the team experienced the effects of relying mostly on discipline and how hard it is to revert that situation without their main continuous improvement tool. Fortunately a call to action saved their moral and put things (and people) together again.

"13476","Giving Agile Teams the Roots to Grow and Wings to Fly","We introduce useful and proven practices that increase the sticking power of new agile teams, allowing them to stay agile long into the future. To create sustainable change, agile teams have to overcome organizational gravity that pulls them back into the old, comfortable ways of working. New agile teams are especially at risk of falling back after the coaches leave or the agile transition is declared 'over'. By helping the team set expectations early, the +15 practices provide support just when the team is most vulnerable, and increases the chance of creating lasting change.



We introduce two concepts, the +15 Team and the +15 Flightplan, that support teams not just at the beginning of a transformation, when management attention and resources are focused on the effort, but much later on as the teams begin unlocking some of the more challenging engineering practices, such as continuous integration or continual refactoring which take time and repeated practice to achieve. You will learn how to work with a new team to apply these concepts, and how the team can use these to guide growth over time.  



Successful Agile transformations are built on successful Agile teams; achieving *sustainable* success depends on helping those teams grow and evolve over time. But in order to be self-organized and self-directed, newly formed agile teams need an example to follow; they need to have a glimpse of where a team can get to after 3, 6 or 12 months of continual retrospection, learning and improvement. Unfortunately, in many cases, there are few examples of such success around them. In a large organization, the inertia of existing cultural norms is likely to weigh down on any visions of excellent execution, diluting the vision and ultimately limiting the success of the teams and the transition.  



The +15 Team is a simple exercise to focus the team on developing good agile behaviors that provide the roots from which a team can grow. The +15 Flightplan is a workshop or game that delivers a long-term plan for agile maturity created by the team that allows the team to soar over time. Participants will be introduced to this technique as a way to better guide the team s development over time as well as learn how and when to respond.  Spending just minutes at every retrospective using these artifacts can make the difference between a team returning to old habits and performance levels or striding forward to become self-directed, high-performing agile teams.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Adoption & Transformation","Workshop","90 minutes","Texas 2","Thursday 09:00 - 10:30","Dave Sharrock",,"dave.sharrock@agile42.com",,"Practicing"

"13608","Kanban Pizza Game - the Kanban experience for foodies","The Kanban Pizza Game is a unique experience of the benefits of one-piece flow or limiting your work-in-process. You are the proprietor of a new entrepreneurial enterprise, your very own Pizza Shop. You will experience the frenetic energy required to keep up with your customers' needs before using the three simple prescriptions of Kanban to increase your productivity and even offer your customers more choice. You'll experience some subtleties of the Kanban approach before we tie everything back to how software is delivered using Kanban.



--  

The Kanban Pizza game was created in the summer of 2011, and has been used at Tampere Goes Agile 2011 in Finland and the Agile Coach Camp in Columbus, OH in Sept 2011. Feedback was enthusiastic, and the game has been used numerous times with clients in the passed 6 months to very positive feedback. The benefit of this game over other Kanban experiences is the level of complexity that can be introduced through the variations of pizza slices (for example, incorporating subtle changes in flow through the system).



Some feedback from the Tampere exercise can be seen on the [agile42 blog](http://www.agile42.com/en/blog/2011/09/23/kanban-pizza-game/ ""Kanban Pizza Game"").



Kanban is a tool that allows optimization of a process by visualizing it. Kanban has just three main prescriptions:



1 Visualize the workflow  

2 Limit WIP  

3 Measure and optimize the average lead time  



**Visualize the workflow**  

With the physical production of the Pizza the workflow is always visually present, and with the drawing of the workflow we can reflect the current process.



**Limit WIP**  

Through the game some bottlenecks and queues will emerge. During the game we introduce work-in-process limits to highlight the (often counter-intuitive) benefit of focusing on single piece flow, and so that the teams don't lose points for unused materials. The participants experience that WIP limits are more than just imposed limitations - they change behaviour; people interact more on the overall production, communicate more and help each other when needed.  



**Measure and optimize the average lead time**  

In the game we measure the lead time and the cycle time. We also use a point system to approximate value delivery, and in particular the cost of inventory or waste. 



**Some Benefits of Kanban**  

- Bottlenecks become clearly visible, leading to increased collaboration  

- Evolutionary path to agile software development  

- Provides a way to be agile without iterations, starting where you are  

- Natural tendency to spread throughout an organization  ","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Agile Boot Camp","Workshop","90 minutes","Texas 2","Tuesday 13:30 - 15:00","David Bland","Dave Sharrock","7thpixel@gmail.com","dave.sharrock@agile42.com","Learning"

Some external attributes of quality software free from defects and easy to maintain are reflections of the code s internal qualities. When classes and methods are cohesive, non-redundant, well-encapsulated, assertive, and explicitly coupled, they are less prone to mistakes and far easier to debug, test, and maintain. David Bernstein asserts that paying attention to code quality helps us focus on the key principles, patterns, and practices used by expert developers. If you don t pay attention to critical code quality attributes, iterative development practices can quickly degrade code into a maintenance nightmare. Join David and take a deep dive into the code qualities that make software more maintainable and less bug friendly.

"13721","Beyond Functional Silos with Communities of Practice","Stop me if you ve heard this one before&  An organization aligns its operation around business products with cross-functional teams focused exclusively on each one. The business likes the focus, but soon people start to complain. Functional experts feel isolated and aren t able to tap into their technical peers now isolated in other teams. Common practices become difficult. Functional managers feel left out now that their people are permanently assigned to dedicated cross-functional teams. Overall, the organization gains benefit from the re-alignment, but people can t help but feel they are neglecting their institutional knowledge and have reduced their technical capacity to solve problems. You might think we re talking about an Agile development team, but actually we re talking about Chrysler in the 19902 s when they re-organized their engineering around auto lines.

This session will explore the concept of communities of practice and how they are a vital component for agile organizations. From providing tactical support in issue resolution, to being stewards of knowledge across vast enterprises, and even helping create support for the larger organizational change, communities of practice are a vital component in improving organizational agility. We will walk through the history of communities of practice, from their emergence in fields as disparate as auto manufacturing, consulting, and oil exploration, and show how these concepts apply to agile organizations.

"13776","Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic TDD: Rethinking How We Test","This presentation challenges the ""norm"" for TDD. Testing should be an integral part of your daily programming practice. But you don t always need to derive your code via many test-code-revise-retest cycles to be test-driven. Some find it more natural to outline a related set of tests first, and use those test scenarios to guide them as they write code. Once they ve completed a  good enough  implementation that supports the test scenarios, they then write those tests and incrementally fix any bugs as they go. As long as you don t write hundreds of lines of code without any testing, there isn t a single best way to be Test Driven.



There s a lot to becoming proficient at TDD. Developing automated test suites, refactoring and reworking tests to eliminate duplication, and testing for exceptional conditions, are just a few. Additionally, acceptance tests, smoke tests, integration, performance and load tests support incremental development as well. If all this testing sounds like too much work, well& let s be practical. Testing shouldn t be done just for testing s sake. Instead, the tests you write should give you leverage to confidently change and evolve your code base and validate the requirements of the system. That s why it is important to know what to test, what not to test, and when to stop testing.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Testing & Quality Assurance","Lecture","60 minutes","Dallas 3-4","Thursday 15:30 - 17:00","Joseph Yoder","Rebecca Wirfs-Brock","josephyoder@hotmail.com","rebecca@wirfs-brock.com","Practicing"
"13777","Testing System Qualities","Agile teams incrementally deliver functionality based on user stories. In the sprint to deliver features, frequently software qualities such as security, scalability, performance, and reliability are overlooked. Often these characteristics cut across many user stories. Trying to deal with certain system qualities late in the game can be difficult, causing major refactoring and upheaval of the system s architecture. This churn isn t inevitable. Especially if you adopt a practice of identifying those characteristics key to your system s success, writing quality scenarios and tests, and delivering on these capabilities at the opportune time.



We will show how to write Quality Scenarios that emphasize architecture capabilities such as usability, security, performance, scalability, internationalization, availability, accessibility and the like.

"13801","Scaling Scrum step by step:  The mega framework ","We will describe our experience of scaling scrum from one single team to seven teams during 2010 and 2011. To do that, we will talk about the new meetings  we added to our scrum framework to improve team communication and synchronize the parallel sprints that we run to develop the most important online payment system in Brazil. We will address the steps that we did and the focus on values instead of rules that is the basis of our agile environment.



This work is a continuation of our first paper about this topic (Moving back to scrum and scaling to scrum of scrums in less than one year)) presented at SPLASH 2011 conference. Now we plan to emphasize our  mega scrum framework , that allows us to add more teams to the same product more easily.



Our first work was focused on our experience of implementing scrum in a team that had already tried it and failed and in less than year scaled it to four teams. At this moment, we can say that we have learned how to handle multiple teams in parallel in the same product. Nowadays, we have a framework and for us it is quite simple to start a new team (but it was not easy in the beginning). 



The focus of the first paper was on values like transparency and commitment and a vision that we could have more than two teams working in different backlogs but everyone belonging to one big team. In this propose to agile 2012, we will emphasize the mechanism of framework that we created to scale scrum:  the mega framework .



It is important to say that the development team and the business team agreed that the product backlog had a lot of different areas and the existent team was not sufficient to deliver as the market expected (There are historical reasons for that and we will detail them in the paper). So we started our strategy of adding and hiring people to existent teams before creating new ones. As new people learned the values and how we work, we started a new team.



With more than three teams we learned that it would be important for everyone to know the sprint backlog of the other teams and to know the course of the parallel sprint. So we created two meetings: mega planning and mega daily. The first one happens just after the plannings and the second one in the middle of the sprint. At this point we  created our  mega framework  with the challenges of continuing being agile.



In the beginning (with two or three teams) it was possible to have meetings with everyone, but nowadays, there are so many people   the meetings were not productive and there is no room for everybody. So we learned and adapted them to meet our needs. We will detail that in the paper.



One important lesson that we learned was the necessity of improving the communication of the team and between product owners and scrummasters. So we created some rules to do that, improving our development process. Another important lesson that we learned was that scrummasters and product owners must be synchronized but that was not only their responsibility    the team must know what the other teams are developing. We can detail that and we believe that point is one of the biggest challenges to scale scrum.



Another relevant point to share is that we improved the productivity of the team. We observed that the velocity of the teams increases when they have a focus   with two or three teams, there were many different subjects to handle. Another metric is that the revenue of the business increases in a ratio that is bigger than the team expansion   so the team is delivering value to the clients can be observed in this scenario.



So, we think that story is very useful to the agile community because we have learned a lot (and continue to learn) and now we have a framework that makes easy to add new teams. We also believe that everyone can adapt that to start a process of scaling agile in their teams. Of course we have more details of each point and we plan to discuss them in the paper.

 How can I convince developers to educate themselves? 

 How can I make customers more cooperative? 

 How do I start a European network of Agile and Lean practitioners? 



When transforming organizations and other social systems people usually encounter obstacles. And these obstacles very often involve changing other people s behaviors. Of course, we cannot really _make_ people behave in a different way. We also cannot really make people laugh, and we cannot really make people happy. But&  we can certainly try!



This session is about *Change Management 3.0*. It is a new change management  super model  which views organizations as complex adaptive systems and social networks. The Change Management 3.0 supermodel wraps various existing models (*PDCA*, *ADKAR*, *Adoption Curve* and *The 5 I's*). It lists a few dozen hard questions that can help people in their attempts to change the behaviors of other people in an organization and beyond. No matter whether you are a manager, Scrum Master, Product Owner, software developer or writer, anyone will find it useful to know how to change the world around them.



For example, some of the questions that will be considered are...



"" 	What Are the Crucial Steps?

"" 	How Do You Get Feedback?

"" 	How Do You Make It Desirable?

"" 	What Makes It Sustainable?

"" 	Who Will Be the Innovators?

"" 	How Will You Deal With Skeptics?

"" 	What Is the Group Identity?

"" 	Can You Incentivize Good Behavior?

The most common pattern we see is that teams transform while everything else remains the same. This leads to increased organizational incongruence, disarray, and ultimately failure.  What is needed is a notion of organizational agility that does for the broader organization what software agility does for software delivery teams. In this session we help participants make the case for such a notion, describe the paradigm shift which such a notion calls for, and provide participants with initial steps to influencing organizational agility in their workplace.<!--break-->","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Adoption & Transformation","Workshop","60 minutes","Texas D","Thursday 11:00 - 12:00","Michael Hamman",,"michael@ecosystemae.com",,"Advancing"
"13972","Modeling and Simulation - Answering the tough executive questions of cost/date forecasts","This presentation shows how to apply Monte-carlo simulation to Scrum and Kanban project models, and then use that model in a variety of ways for experimentation. The results can be used to build a date, staff and cost forecast for projects, and to find what development factors (defects, scope-creep, etc.) are causing the most impact. If you hate estimation, this session demonstrates how by modeling your process and teams to determine what estimates will make the biggest difference in forecast, allowing you to eliminate the rest.



<!--break-->



Agile teams and Executive Management of larger enterprises are often at political odds when it comes to needing estimates, delivery forecasts and the impact of outsourcing. Through the use of modeling and simulating Agile projects as described in this session, you have techniques for quickly answering tough management questions without overburdening the development teams. Modeling and simulating potential project outcomes hundreds of times (using estimate ranges rather than single values) achieves a higher degree of outcome certainty leading to accurate forecasts, and well-informed management decisions.



During this session, the process to answer and solve the following questions will be explained -



 1. Does it make economic sense to outsource development or testing?

 2. What is the dollar cost of poor quality code (defect leakage)? 

 3. Do I manage the added-scope problem, or code quality problem first? 

 4. How do I get the staff I need?



By the end of this session you  will understand the basics of modeling and simulation, understand the types of problems simulation solves, how to communicate likelihood of outcomes with executive leadership, and be positioned to start applying these fundamentals on your own teams and projects.

"13979","The UX of User Stories","Agile methods emerged in the highly task-oriented world of enterprise software, where it made a good deal of sense to expect that a customer would be able to tell developers what features the software should contain.  ""I need to first be able to do this, and then I need to be able to do that, and after that I want to be able to see a list of the other thing,"" and so on.  And thus User Stories were formed around that premise.  Within that world, they ve become incredibly powerful and nimble tools for team communication, planning, and more.



But software products have moved well beyond those shores.  Today s software is often either too complex or too experience-oriented for customers to know what features to ask for, or worse, they think they know what to ask for, but that is based on a dated understanding of evermore rapidly evolving interface paradigms.



In this hybrid lecture/workshop, we ll show how a UX-oriented approach to story development can help teams transform often fuzzy and emotion-oriented customer needs and desires into actual estimable features that a software team can build and deliver.  We ll also show how the old delivery-focused model of story development is highly revealing of the origins of Agile UX dysfunction (e.g. the  feeding the beast  phenomenon), and how a UX-oriented approach can mitigate or eliminate much of that dysfunction.



Topics covered will include:  



* What makes user stories powerful and how they can help traditional UX designers understand and learn how to use lean conversation-centered documents.   

* Why and how to have customers/users write problem- or experience-oriented stories instead of the more common solution-oriented  As a& I want to..so that..  story format.  

* Why and how to integrate UI exploration with story mapping to achieve much more reliable story estimates.  

* How to ensure that UI stories (ie those which are necessary for a good user experience, but which a customer is unlikely to know to ask for, such as navigation breadcrumbs) are made part of a sprint backlog.  

* Understanding the meaning of a story being Done vs being Validated, in which the former is about planning and enabling teams to make progress, while the latter is about product wholeness and success.

"14013","Get Over It!  Stop Obsessing Over CMMI and Get On with Being Great!","Incompatibilities between CMMI and agile have largely been due to misapplication of CMMI stemming from a narrow and misguided understanding of CMMI.  This is exacerbated when CMMI is viewed as a compliance standard for defining heavyweight processes rather than an improvement model to increase performance.



Isn't it about time the Agile community just moved on and stopped dwelling and obsessing over CMMI and its supposed incompatibilities with agile?  Yeah, I said it, _supposed_.  There is nothing in CMMI that demands incompatibilities with agile practices, values, or the principles behind the manifesto.  Any incompatibilities are due to either how people have inappropriately wielded CMMI, abused agile, or both.



Most information/presentations about successes and failures of CMMI (with or without agile) have largely done little more than highlight what various organizations managed to do to satisfy appraisals.  However, this compliance-driven perspective leaves out critical information about what CMMI actually works, how the appraisal is actually conducted, and how to use CMMI for actual improvement rather than appraisal compliance.  In fact, most information and presentations on the integration of CMMI and agile have done very little to stem the tidal surge of misinformation and ""CMMI malpractice"" about how to actually work with CMMI -- both for the benefits of improvement as well as for getting coveted ratings.



CMMI is a model.  Models are tools.  Before using any tool, users need instructions -- or at least they need to know what the tool is for and whether or not they've got the right problem solved by the tool.  This lively, interactive, micro-tutorial will lay plain what CMMI is and how it works so that implementation of the model is clear thereby laying the groundwork for both the benefits of CMMI as well as achieving desired appraisal results.



Properly used, CMMI can actually help lean and agile teams learn about themselves, find weaknesses in the way they work, improve their effectiveness and increase their performance.  The session will share what I've done with clients for 10+ years that results in these outcomes -- while also achieving CMMI ratings -- while remaining entirely faithful to agile values and principles.



The learning outcomes will prepare teams to pursue CMMI effectively with ""level ratings"" as a by-product of actual performance increases.","Option 1: First speaker receives any compensation (180 minute)","Enterprise Agile","Lecture","180 minutes","Dallas 6-7","Monday 09:00 - 12:30","Hillel Glazer",,"agilecmmi@gmail.com",,"Advancing"

Precor has distinguished itself as a worldwide industry leader, providing state-of-the-art fitness equipment to health clubs, hotels, spas, fitness centers, and private homes all over the world.



Precor is number one in the fitness equipment industry in both product offerings and service quality [Source: 2009 Health Club Equipment Benchmarking Report].  At the same time Precor is a great place to work, as evidenced by honors as a finalist in the Puget Sound Business Journal's 2010 Washington's Best Workplaces in the Large Business category.



Precor began by launching the first ergonomically sound rowing machine in 1980, and have been supporting the natural movement of the human body ever since. In 1990, Precor created the first cushioned treadmill. Precor introduced the world to the Elliptical Fitness Crosstrainer""! (EFXﾮ) in 1995. Then in 2007, Precor released the revolutionary Adaptive Motion Trainerﾮ (AMTﾮ), a breakthrough piece of cardio equipment that constantly and fluidly adapts to your stride length and motion.



Precor decided to continue its leadership and innovation by delivering a completely new fitness experience through the use of embedded and networked capabilities.  This represents a significant shift from a product mindset to a platform capability for Precor.  Software became extremely complex and a critical competency for Precor which was a radical and transformative change.  This research paper investigates the trials and tribulations of developing a whole new competency in software in order to deliver our next level of innovation.

Local, state and federal governments around the world are all facing budget shortfalls, spending cuts and reduced services. All of us   ordinary citizens, elected officials, civic and community leaders   know that we must make dramatic changes to solve these crises, and yet governments remain gridlocked. How do we move beyond this impasse? How do we create an approach to budgeting that is both participatory and scalable? The answer lies in the serious games pioneered by the Agile Community.



In this interactive lecture, participants will learn to conduct in-person and online games built specifically for resolving multi-dimensional budget problems. These games are based on games that have been played for years in the Agile Community. In this session, however, we'll demonstrate that by challenging our own definitions of leadership, we can demonstrate that practices common in many Agile teams can have a massive impact. 



We will detail the Budget Games played in San Jose, CA, on Jan. 29, 2011 and Jan 21, 2011. In both sessions more than 100 community leaders collaboratively re-crafted the city s proposed budget. Because the games, which were graciously facilitated pro-bono by many members of the Agile Community, generated actionable consensus, San Jose officials were able to act on the game s results with more confidence than traditional polling. In the workshop, participants will learn how to run a budget game in their own community and help refine both the in-person and online game prototypes.



Brief overview of our process and results from January 2011 (the Jan 2012 games have not been completed):



1. The San Jose Mayor s office created  a list of 18 funding proposals that community leaders could purchase using the basic game structure of the Innovation Gameﾮ _Buy a Feature_. The total cost of these items was $14,000,000. The list of items that we used in this game can be found here: [funding proposals](http://innovationgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fundingproposals.pdf).



2. Community leaders organized into groups of between 7 and 9 players, with 8 players / game as the most common configuration. Each player was given $200,000 to purchase items they wanted. This was a very constrained game, and Community leaders quickly determined that they couldn t buy much.



3. The Mayor s office created a second list of budget cuts that the Community leaders could select through unanimous agreement to get more money. This list of potential budget cuts we used in this game can be found here: [reduction proposals](http://innovationgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/reductionproposals.pdf).



4. The pricing and structure of items on either list cannot be adjusted (this is a standard rule for _Buy a Feature_ games).



5. One Innovation Gamesﾮ Trained Facilitator and One Innovation Gamesﾮ Trained Observer managed each group to minimize researcher bias and record key aspects of the negotiations.



6. The game was played for 90 minutes.



7. There was no requirement that any items were purchased or cut. The community leaders were in complete control of their virtual money.



8. We prepared a [final report}(http://innovationgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/BidsOnly-Raw-Game-Data.pdf) that allowed City leaders to take action.





An even more thorough review of the event results can be found [here](http://innovationgames.com/2011/02/san-jose-ca-community-leaders-budget-games-results/).

Developers who carefully craft their code need to stop treating HTML and CSS as annoying implementation details. We need to up our game, bringing craftsmanship to the presentation layer.



Does CSS drive you nuts? Do you struggle through getting your site looking okay on one browser, only to find out that it looks like a trainwreck on others? Do suffer recurring nightmares about Internet Explorer? Do you fight with your designers because they keep sending you things that look pretty, but just don't seem to work in real life? Is your HTML and CSS a pile of ugly, hacky, brittle code that mars your otherwise beautiful codebase?



HTML and CSS can be beautiful, and - dare I say it - fun. The trick is to think like they do, so you can outsmart them. I'm a dev at heart, but I've learned some great secrets along that way that have helped me develop - and more importantly, maintain - some high profile, beautiful websites. I'll share 8 important tips for coming to terms with, outsmarting, and kindling a romance with HTML.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Development Practices & Craftsmanship","Lecture","60 minutes","San Antonio 1-3","Tuesday 11:00 - 12:00","Jon Galloway",,"jongalloway@gmail.com",,"Practicing"

At the Agile Alliance's ""Supporting Agile Adoption"" workshop in December 2011, Jutta Eckstein, Diana Larsen, and James Shore tackled this problem with a new change model targeted at Agile transformations. The model gives change leaders a tool for understanding the context of their transformation, for choosing which changes to focus on, and deciding whether to take a deterministic or adaptive approach to each one.



The change model is new and experimental. In this workshop, Diana, James, and Jutta will present the model, invite you to apply it to your situation, and use your feedback to further improve the model.","Option 1: First speaker receives any compensation (180 minute)","Adoption & Transformation","Workshop","180 minutes","Texas D","Monday 13:30 - 17:00","Jutta Eckstein","James Shore","jutta@jeckstein.com","jshore@jamesshore.com","Advancing"

Over the past year, we have been working with large projects (over 100 people), distributed in several countries and helping them develop organizational models that they can use to visualize how teams and work could be best organized to maximize agility.



In this workshop, we will guide the participants through the process of assessing and developing organizational models that represent a fractal that can be replicated to scale as needed. The models provide business stakeholders with a tool to assess the pros and cons of different organizational models visually and rapidly. Whether you are responsible for building a large scale global Agile organization, or are a team member with ideas on how to organize teams and work, this workshop will provide you with tools to develop organizational ""preto-types"" you can use for communication and troubleshooting large-scale Agile organizational design.

"14737","Evolve Your Agile Coaching Dashboard","As Agile Coaches, we know the importance of helping teams make their work visible and transparent. This concept extends to our own practice as well. Over the course of a year coaching more than a dozen Scrum teams, I created several iterations of a coaching dashboard - all of them big visible charts on the wall - to help me be systematic and in tune with the changes taking place in the organization.



The first dashboard could be characterized as ""Using Scrum to coach Scrum teams."" The dashboard looked like a typical card wall with the teams as backlog items and columns for tracking my tasks to support them. The dashboard was tactical in nature and focused on the coaching tasks. I found I was repeating many of the same tasks, like ""coach X team to do Y,"" and rewriting the same sticky notes got old. I made some minor tweaks to the dashboard, but it remained useful only to me since I was the wall's sole user.



The next major iteration really got people's attention. I made the wall look like a project dashboard. It had 10 yes or no criteria based on Jeff Sutherland's ideas about hyper-productive Scrum teams, and I posted the answers as green or red sticky notes. Having these simple criteria on the wall really challenged the Scrum Masters (most of them former project managers) who hated seeing something ""red"" beside their team. This dashboard ultimately attracted frequent visits from the CIO, who was used to high-tech solutions for metrics reporting, and said ""This is the simplest, most intuitive bit of reporting that I have in my organization.""



The next two iterations of the coaching dashboard were driven by successfully launching a Scrum Adoption Team chartered to support widespread adoption of Scrum. We became a team of coaches, and we used a Kanban(ish) dashboard to systematize our workflow. We used the wall to stay focused on delivering value, and when we saw our work piling up, we would look for the root cause. That insight drove our final coaching dashboard. We needed to know where to strategically invest to improve the agility of the organization. At regular intervals we would survey each team along six dimensions - Scrum process, teamwork, knowledge creation, requirements, planning, and technical practices. [See spider diagram dashboard] We knew intuitively that technical practices were a key opportunity for growth, but having a tool to visualize this data has finally led senior managers to begin investing in them.



Participants in this workshop will come away with ideas for creating and evolving their own Agile coaching dashboards.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Coaching & Mentoring","Workshop","90 minutes","Ft.

"14752","Scaling Lean|Agile Development to the Large Enterprise with the Scaled Agile Framework","The continuing knock on XP, Scrum and Kanban is that they may work well for small, collocated teams, but they do not scale to the needs of the larger software enterprise. In this presentation, Dean Leffingwell will finally dispel this myth by describing the Scaled Agile Framework""!, a well-defined and publicly available set of practices which have been used to successfully scale Lean|Agile development to hundreds and even thousands of practitioners at companies like BMC Corporation, John Deere and many others. Results typically include quality and productivity improvements of from 20-50%, along with increases in employee engagement and job satisfaction.



In this presentation, Leffingwell will describe how the three key Agile constructs   team, backlog and timebox  can be scaled to the program and portfolio levels of the enterprise. However, since simply making Agile things bigger does not necessarily keep a system lean, Leffingwell will describe how the framework a) keeps work in process visible and limited, b) keeps backlogs and queues short, c) uses cadence and synchronization to align teams to a common mission, and d) applies system-level continuous integration to facilitate fast customer feedback. 



The presentation also includes a description of kanban systems to manage the flow of the business and architectural epics that drive the agile programs. 



The presentation concludes with a discussion of how lean thinking executives are instrumental in helping the enterprise achieve the ultimate business benefits that these innovate processes can deliver.

The PMO and keepers of the corporate yearly planning cycle still cling to traditions of waste.  The true need to optimize the whole is fog bound by mystic thinking.

Keepers of the enterprise ken know Agile is wrong.  The status quo is correct.  Affronts are hurled down on Agile teams.  Self-organizing teams can never improve processes beyond the team.  It is not feasible to deliver value to the customer every sprint.  Agile teams can not plan beyond the current sprint.  Scrum of Scrums is a failed theory to coordinate multiple teams.  It just can t scale.  Agile sees no need for automated testing or up front unit testing.  We need documentation!

Let's answer with a relative estimation: It's as different as soccer and basketball. Besides both being team sports and the goal to score more points than the other team, everything else if different. If software and IC development are that different, why should Agile work in an IC development environment? Wait! Let's have a closer look. There are more commonalities as you can see on the first glance. IC development also requires satisfying customer requirements as early as possible, deals with changing requirements, needs to have frequent product releases and requires technical excellence and good design. And these are certainly areas where agile principles have been proven to be successful. 



As an IC development organization for an embedded microcontroller we experienced over the last projects that the ""game"" changed. While projects got more complex and development cycle times longer, customers required products earlier than before and new requirements came up more frequently. It was time to change the way we play!



This talk demonstrates how we changed our existing IC development flow to an Agile IC development process. It shows which agile practices we ve chosen and how we applied them to our development process. It shows the challenges we faced in the transition and the success stories we experienced. It also gives an outlook how the process can be even more agile. 



The session isn t tailored to hardware developers only. I envision a lively discussion among participants from different domains on how the development process can be further refined, enhanced, applied to other organizations and maybe it can also trigger some additional thoughts for existing agile practitioners.

What are these  magic  activities? Let's take a look.



Start with creating a culture of trust. While we can't make people trust each other, leaders can create an environment that fosters trust building. Next, Agile is based on team ownership. However, many leaders struggle with how to help teams take ownership and often make the mistake by taking ownership back from teams.Leaders cannot change or ""fix"" people. People do what they are passionate about. Leaders who match passion and skills to roles on teams can see improved productivity. Finally, integrity is essential. These tools are all free.

"14909","Down the Pub: How did that transition you were working on go?","Imagine a reunion in the pub between you, an agile coach, and some Ericsson managers. You met some years before and the seed of an idea was planted. Over a long evening you discussed what the world would look like after completing a large-scale agile transformation. Three years later, you catch up, and learn that the transformation has been a roaring success. Through the evening you share the ups and downs, the lessons learned, and the critical success factors that made the success.



Three years ago Ericsson started on a long journey to agility - over 1000 people adopting an agile mindset after over 30 years of entrenched control gate processes. Back then, there was fear and uncertainty, a will to control and preserve what made the organization successful. Today there is a completely different culture. A culture that allows the organization to sustain and keep on evolving, that allows them to achieve significant results long after you, as the coach, left. Obviously, you want to learn what worked so well? Was it your coaching ability (of course!)? Was it the uniqueness of the organization (well, they are special, but unique? No!)? What made this such a persistent and sustainably successful transformation?



This is an exciting tale. In just three short years, Ericsson has made monumental changes, including:

 - Significantly improved predictability, in particular in relation to customers and the business department. The product pipeline is solid and reliable, and managed through business value, not release content.

 - Significantly improved quality, allowing Ericsson to exceed expectations even of the most demanding customers, releasing newly developed functionality ahead of schedule and skipping previously critical integration and verification gates in the process.



Though many organizations achieve this while being coached, Ericsson has built up an internal capability able to continually learn and improve. Reflecting on what went well, we have identified five keys to sustainable change. The first two, People and Practices, are well-understood. The last three, Perseverance, Protection and Patience, are more cultural characteristics. You will learn how these were introduced and encouraged, and how Ericsson was able to bring about widespread adoption of such deep skills in a very short time.



If you are interested in knowing how an organization with a couple of thousand employees was able to learn how to continuously improve, and make that transformation to agility a successful long lasting journey, you can't miss this fly-on-the-wall view of the pub reunion.

What happens when you need to deliver a medium to large sized program that require more people? Scrum gives no guidance on scaling. There are books and ideas out there ( Scrum of Scrums , Integration Scrum teams) but none have delivered reliable results. These techniques often reduce the sense of collaboration and agility as the programs get larger. Decisions feel more autocratic, teams have a lower sense of control and happiness. Dynamic Governance (see http://www.governancealive.com/dynamic-governance/) may provide the answer. Called by some  Scrum s big brother , Dynamic Governance is an organizational method  that uniquely combines  best business practices with the principles of cybernetics and systems thinking to deliver a decision-making mechanism that works at scale. Developed in The Netherlands, it has been used successfully in organizations for over 40 years. This workshop will demonstrate how Scrum is a Dynamic Governance system for 1 team. It suggests some improvements, particularly for retrospective meetings. However, the workshop will focus primarily on applying Agile philosophy and the 3 principles of Dynamic Governance to design organizations at different levels of scale, including top management and organizational units that are not directly involved in the production of software. Decisions are made quickly, are biased toward action, and stick.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Enterprise Agile","Workshop","90 minutes","Ft.

How do we encourage an environment where developers do not hold code sacrilegious and feel free to refactor or delete code? This session will go over strategies for teams to embrace YAGNI and celebrate the purging of dead code.



For the majority of the presentation I will talk about how a team I was on came to produce a 500+ page  Big Book Of Dead Code  off of a legacy application. Producing this book reduced build times, reduced bugs, and became rallying point for developers. It s very existence helped encourage simple design and clean code. It also spawned a competition amongst developers to see who could add more to the book. I will also talk about how this powerful visualization helped to change the way the business itself thought about code, planning, and quality.  



I would expect this presentation to be of benefit to almost everyone involved in software development but especially for anyone struggling with trying to introduce agile and TDD to a legacy application.



I have presented at various Iowa technology related user groups and IT departments. I have also been involved with the Hyperstream project from the Technology Association of Iowa. This is a project where local technologists work with high school and middle school students on projects that benefit the school and the community. The goal of the project is to encourage young people to purse careers in technology. This goes beyond just programming and includes art and design, marketing, business, and science.  I work directly with students as a mentor on a weekly basis and I help the students present their projects to school boards and the community.  My style is pretty loose and I try to keep the group engaged by not overloading on too much raw data at once. If you are looking for Agile Alliance reviewers who have worked with me and can give you a feel for my style please talk to Tim Ottinger or Brandon Carlson.

"15003","Take your team to the next level: from Adoption to Transition","Some teams seem to benefit more than others from the agile practices they introduce. Why is this? Most of the agile practices are well described, some of them even have whole books dedicated to how they work and how they can be customized to your specific organization and context. Yet, for many teams, applying these practices seems a significant challenge that sometimes even leads to less than good results and moving away from the introduced practices altogether.

The foundation of many of the agile practices is collaboration, not just working next to one another, but true collaboration around a common goal.

"15034","Scaling Agile with Multiple Teams: Using Lean to Drive Business Value","This program will share Lean-Agile principles that guide both what to build and how to coordinate the teams that need to build it. We will cover how to apply these principles when there are several teams involved in creating software using either Scrum or Kanban development approaches.



A common intent of all Agile methods is threefold:

1. Build the most valuable features

2. Build them efficiently

3. Minimize creating extra work



The challenge to accomplishing this is not that great for one team working independently. However, when several teams have to coordinate, the challenges greatly magnify. When implementing software over several teams, we have found it to be valuable to manage the workflow from the perspective of what will provide value to the business   not quite the same thing as customer value. This can be used to guide how to slice work up into smaller chunks, enabling at least quick feedback, if not quick delivery, to ensure the right products are being built. A lot of thrashing can take place when teams work with poor coordination   greatly lowering efficiency. In large scale development, it is clear that working on the right functions, and coordinating their construction across teams is essential.



Having teams coordinate amongst themselves has been the popular method. Unfortunately, this approach, typified by Scrum-of-Scrums, has a dismal track record. Having discovered the correct principles underneath large scale development, we now believe we understand why coordinating teams as a set of peer development organizations, can rarely be an optimal approach. Teams need to be guided by the value they are building, while self-organizing to improve the embedded feedback loops of development. The self-organization techniques required vary, depending upon several factors. These principles, not surprisingly, are directly related to the 3 intents mentioned above. This seminar will present both the principles underneath large scale feature implementation, as well as a few case studies demonstrating different implementations of these principles.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Enterprise Agile","Lecture","90 minutes","Austin 1-3","Tuesday 13:30 - 15:00","Alan Shalloway",,"alshall@netobjectives.com",,"Practicing"
"15039","De-Mystifying Kanban: Understanding Its Many Faces","There is a lot of confusion about what Kanban is.  Some of this is due to the fact that many people who have never used Kanban have been deriding it   saying it is a mechanistic team management method that doesn t respect people. The fact that Kanban is quickly growing and gaining a reputation for success where other Agile methods have had challenges belies that categorization.



But what is Kanban?  Even when listening to Kanban thought leaders one will hear different answers.  1) it s a power agile management system based on lean-flow. 2) it s a transition management method to assist teams to achieve continuous learning.   3) It s a way to create visibility for executives to improve their product portfolio management.  I can almost here Gilda Radner and Dan Aykroyd on Saturday Night Live describing New Shimmer!



This talk discusses how Kanban actually is a multi-faceted method that assists process, transition and collaboration.  Kanban is not a mere tool, or even a set of practices. It s a mindset that attends to people, their culture, and the systems they find themselves working in.  The talk presents a few of the basics of Lean-Flow and theory of constraints that it is based on as well as some of the psychological aspects of people adopting new methods. 



While this talk is intended for those considering adopting Kanban, those currently using Scrum will find it helpful as many of the principles and practices of Kanban fit well into the Scrum framework.

"15042","Continuous Feedback: Practicing Innovation Skills","The development of the first machine-powered aircraft and the first human-powered aircraft had a lot in common. Both development teams created an experimental environment in which flights took place daily, modifications were made after every flight, crashes were expected and easy to recover from, and finally, problems were tackled methodically, one at a time until a solution emerged. There is a lot we can learn about development by studying these breakthrough inventions, but perhaps the most critical lesson is the importance of fast feedback loops in a development organization. This talk is about using feedback control to radically improve the process of developing of software-intensive systems. It covers:



1.	Continuous Delivery: A surge in organizations engaged in continuous delivery (weekly, daily, or more frequently) has changed the development game from iterations to flow, and from intermediary product  owners  to sending system-level feedback directly to the technical team.



2.	Continuous Design: Continuous delivery requires the ability to continuously take the feedback into account and adjust the software content accordingly. Instead of designing features based on speculation, system development decisions are based on real data   for example, A/B testing, Cohort analysis, etc. 



3.	Continuous Demand Management: One of the biggest problems development managers face is demand management   and resolving this problem is fundamentally about the ability to match demand to capability. A rapid full-system feedback control loop is increasingly practical, and is a very effective way to manage demand. 



4.	Continuous Progress: Recent research has shown that the most potent motivator, the one that gets people deeply engaged in their work is not incentives, not goals, not even teams.  The most effective motivator of knowledge workers is: making progress in meaningful work. Continuous delivery and design put members of the technical team in direct contact with the end result of their work   making the work more meaningful and progress highly visible.



5.	Continuous Experimentation: Research also shows that the most successful organizations are those that take a disciplined, empirical approach to improving business processes   questioning conventional wisdom and experimenting to find out what works. This includes questioning the conventional wisdom behind approaches to developing software-intensive systems   including agile and lean approaches.

"15106","Affordance-Driven Process Improvement:  Designing a Process that Works for Your Team","The best processes are those that encourage teams to naturally do the right things at the right times. Amazing processes like this don t happen by accident; they are specifically designed to encourage desirable behavior while discouraging harmful behaviour. By carefully choosing the process s affordances -- practices or artifacts that direct our thinking toward a specific goal -- a team can tailor a process that makes success intuitive. The session will begin by presenting the core concepts behind affordence-driven process improvement before diving into a collaborative workshop. 



During the workshop teams (tables) will use information from the introduction to brainstorm values (as quality attribute stories) and affordances that will help them promote those values. By the the end of this workshop attendees will have produced posters which serve as **actionable examples they can take home to their teams -- and artifacts for continuing the conversation in the hallways.** 



In this workshop, teams will address the following questions: 



* What properties does my team value in a process?



* What techniques/methods/processes promote or inhibit specific properties? 



* What is a process affordance and how can I choose the right ones for my team to drive process improvement?



* How do I pick the right process for my team?





**Intended Audience**



* People new to agile who don t know where to start



* High-level executives and managers who want to take an active role in shaping their team s future



* Process improvement professionals who want to explore a new way to look at teams and organizations



* All design, Process  and team fanatics

"15135","Let's Stay Agile! Applying the Framework for Agile Sustainability in our Teams","How do we sustain the use of agile methodologies both in our project teams and in our organisations? How do we know we have improved our project performance by using agile methods? How can we assimilate agile methods more deeply into our organisations? These questions are the focus of this workshop on agile sustainability. 



Much of our time is spent understanding how to implement agile methodologies but less is spent on understanding how we can sustain these methodologies and the ramifications if we do not sustain them. Agile methodologies have well passed the phases of adoption in many organisations.  Yet the ultimate success of an agile methodology depends on the sustained use of the method both on the project team and in the organisation. 



Within an organisation, the greater the amount of project teams using agile methods and the deeper the use of agile practices are assimilated into that organisation, the greater the likelihood of specific improvements in agile systems development outcomes. However, what facilitates the early stages of agile assimilation in an organisation is different to what facilitates the later stages of the assimilation. 



Therefore, this workshop and its participants will discuss the key factors that either facilitate or prevent the sustainability of agile methods in an organization. We will discuss how to achieve significant improvements in agile systems development projects and provide an overview of mechanisms that can be used to track improvements during organizational assimilation of agile methods. 



Participants should have at least two years working experience in agile projects and include a wide range of roles such as manager, scrum master, business analyst, product owner, testers and developers.

Have you generated excitement for these new ideas, seen them seem to take root and grow, only to find a year later that people have fallen back into their old ways of doing things?  Or, are they now cherry picking Agile practices, perhaps using Agile terms, but ignoring the Agile values?   If so, you are not alone.    In this talk, Tamara Sulaiman Runyon discusses some reasons why simple practice adoption is not enough; and why transformation is so difficult to make stick in many organizations. Topics include: the nature of change and complex systems models   where do we fit?  The key role that vision and leadership play in instigating  and supporting transformation;  the potential iceberg of organizational culture as a change blocker,  as well as people aspects    the levels of discomfort caused by any change; and measuring the growth of competence as Agile practices and values are assimilated.

"15151","Understanding Agile Program and Portfolio Management","More than 10 years after the signing of the Agile Manifesto, agile is now officially mainstream. PMI is offering an agile certification and you can't hardly find an IT job description that doesn't ask for some sort of Agile experience.  As a community, we've become pretty good at setting up agile teams and delivering agile projects.  The next frontier for agile methods is tackling the enterprise and one of the toughest nuts to crack will the the traditional PMO.  



In larger more complex environments, it isn't sufficient to pair a single product owner with a single team and expect that the work of the business is going to get done. We are dealing with larger, more diverse groups of stakeholders, stakeholders who's needs often compete for the attention of the team.  Furthermore, the teams have to work together in more complex ways that require tighter integration across teams to deliver larger, more complex feature sets.  



This talk will explore patterns for dealing with more complex organizations, managing interdependencies between teams, and balancing tradeoffs to optimize the project delivery organization.  The key question to answer is 'when will we be done, and what will we get for our time and money'.  We want to give the PMO a way to answer this question without having to resort to traditional plan-driven approaches.  This talk will lay out just such an approach.

"15154","Patterns for Agile Adoption and Transformation","Introducing agile into an organization is more than just running people through a few days of training and hoping for the best.  Training is part of the equation but only addresses one part of the adoption and transformation cycle.  The problem with a training-only approach is that we can learn new ways of working, but if the structure and culture of the organization don't support those new ways of working, the training won't stick.  The trick is to create an organizational structure and culture that is congruent with training in agile practices.  We need a structure and culture where Agile practices can flourish and grow and produce the business outcomes we all hope for.  



This talk will start by exploring the main differences between agile adoption and agile transformation and how to distinguish between structural transformation and cultural transformation.  Next we'll explore criteria for how to assess your organization and create an adoption and transformation roadmap to help you pragmatically and safely introduce agile methods to your enterprise.  Finally we'll explore three primary dimensions of adoption and transformation:  competency, frequency, and scale that will assist in guiding your adoption and transformation roadmap and change management strategy. 



After establishing the theoretical underpinning of a successful adoption and transformation strategy, we'll consider several case studies where these ideas have been applied and what has worked, and more importantly, what hasn't.  The case studies will consider 3-5 companies of varying sizes where these ideas have been applied in the past 18 months.

"15193","Where do agile leaders come from?","Becoming truly agile requires a significant change in the leadership practices and in behavior of the managers. One aspect of this change is the transformation from command and control to servant leadership and supporting self-organization, which is not an easy one for many managers and teams. Over the years I have worked with many organizations helping teams and managers on the road to become more self-organizing and agile. Very often I have heard from teams that ""we would like to self-organize, but management will not let us . And from managers of the same organization: ""we would like the teams to self-organize, but they just don't want to take the power and responsibility"".  



Teams and managers seem to be trapped in the same mental model of hierarchical relationships and command & control leadership without being able to get out of this. In order to get out of this trap people need to start to think differently, feel differently and behave differently.



In this session I will share my experience of coaching teams, managers and leadership teams so that the needed changes happen. We will cover the key concepts we have found helpful in changing the mental models. I will also talk about the coaching and training programs we have in place and tell examples of how the process of creating new leadership culture has progressed.

"15263","Agile and the nature of decision making","Organizations are really bad at Risk Management. And the typical approaches to risk management are flawed - resulting in bureaucratic overhead and not much improvement in the performance of software development projects. Agile efforts have rejected bureaucratic and non-value adding efforts and in the process have rejected most of what is practiced as risk management. This is unfortunate - because the nature of agile development fundamentally changes how to benefit from effective risk management. 



Risk management is about managing uncertainty to reduce the probability and impact of unfortunate events and the maximize the realization of opportunities. This workshop builds on concepts from SEI's MOSAIC project and Eric Reis Lean Start-up to present a practical and proven to a systemic approach to integrating threat and opportunity identification and response into the management of Agile projects. Useful for typical delivery teams, this approach is particularly valuable in the large projects and large organizations.

"15289","Risk Management is Too Important for Project Managers","This workshop introduces an integrated set of collaborative team games for the entire risk management process. It starts by explaining the significance of risk management on projects by reviewing research statistics on the billions of dollars wasted annually on projects that fail due to poor risk management.  Having established the importance of risk management a set of 8 new team based tools for agile risk management are introduced. By deliberately moving risk management from a project management activity to a team activity we dramatically increase the collective knowledge, visibility and in-depth insights into the issues and solutions for project risks. 



Through collaborative games each of the 6 PMI Risk Management steps are recreated as highly visual, team based activities that then create risk avoidance and risk mitigation stories for the product backlog



1.	**Plan Your Trip**   (Risk Management Planning)

a.	4Cs - Consider the Context, Costs, Consequences and Choices

b.	Deposits and Bank Fees   understanding features and risks

2.	**Find Friends and Foes**   (Risk and Opportunity Identification)

a.	Doomsday clock, 

b.	Karma-day

c.	Other risk identification forms (risk profiles, project risk lists, retrospectives, user story analysis, Waltzing with Bears - Top 5-10 for software)

3.	**Post Your Ad**   (Qualitative Risk Analysis)

a.	Investors and Help Wanted   classification and visualization of opps and risks

b.	Tug of War   project categorization 

4.	**Today s Forecast** - (Quantitative Risk Analysis)

a.	Dragons Den   next best dollar spent 

b.	Battle Bots - simulations

5.	**Backlog Injector**   (Risk Response Planning)

a.	Junction Function   choose the risk response path

b.	Dollar Balance   Risk / Opp EVM to ROI comparison

c.	Report Card - Customer/Product owner engagement

d.	Inoculator   inject risk avoidance/mitigation and opportunity stories into backlog

6.	**Risk Radar**   (Risk Monitoring and Control)

a.	Risk Burn Down Graphs - Tracking and monitoring

b.	Risk Retrospectives - Evaluating the effectiveness of the risk management plan

c.	Rinse and Repeat - Updating risk management artifacts, revisiting process



These techniques overcome many of the correct-but-not-sufficient aspects of traditional risk management:

	* Poor engagement - dry, boring, academic, done by PM, does not drive enough change

	* Done once   typically near the start, when we know least about the project

	* Not revisited enough   often  parked  off to one side and not reviewed again

	* Not integrated into project lifecycle   poor tools for task integration

	* Not engaging, poor visibility   few stakeholders regularly review the project risks



Why so visual? Visual representation helps engage the left and right hemi-spheres of the brain. They allow us to tap into our spatial awareness / memory to avoid forgetting about risks and are the reason today s military use visual tokens to represented enemy forces, despite having access to sophisticated tools. The impacts of forgetting about them can be fatal. The same goes for project risks.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Enterprise Agile","Workshop","90 minutes","Ft.

"15290","Why Agile Needs More Cowboys","This presentation takes the leadership ideas of Jeffrey Pinto author of  Project Leadership: from Theory to Practice  and transforms them into an agile setting.



Cowboys are resourceful, daring, and are as quick with their wits as they are with their fists. In many ways, we see cowboys as the embodiment of agile leaders. Yet, life is not a Hollywood movie. What do cowboys actually do? They lead cows. Have you ever seen anything that indicates that John Wayne knows how to lead cows? They ride horses, shoot guns, and always get the girl. But have you ever seen them with a cow? Would you want them around a cow? Your cow? They can teach us as much about being a good cowboy as Homer Simpson can teach us about being a good father.



Go behind the myth, and true agile leadership characteristics emerge. A herd of cows is a lot like an organization: massive and, at times, rather aimless. It takes dedicated leadership using a score of methods to energize this bovine bulk. A good cowboy knows how to select a lead cow, direct the herd into natural flows to help lead the herd.



Moving a herd into Dodge City required considerable skill. It is the real cowboy, not a stylized caricature, that teaches us something about leadership. 



Agile leadership is not a cookbook. You will find no recipes for leadership stew here. Rather, this presentation is intended as a guide to leadership thought and practice. Good theory underlies good leadership. Theory has received a bad rap. After all, we want doers, not thinkers, right? But, at its heart, leadership is concerned with transforming ideas and concepts into action. Your knowledge of basic principles is essential to you taking the first step to being an effective agile leader. Our six-shooter of agile leadership topics to be introduced is:



1.	Craft a compelling vision of the completed project

2.	Model the desired behaviour towards this vision

3.	Resist meddling and recognize team conflict as a positive step

4.	Act for the simultaneous welfare of the team and the project

5.	Create an environment of functional accountability

6.	Take time to reflect on the project and challenge the process

These are the voyages of the starship, Agile.

Its ten-year mission: to explore strange, new projects, to seek out new value and new solutions, to boldly go where no teams have gone before.""



In this episode join our team as they discover the space station 'Warehouse' adrift. Captain Tuple and his crew discover the foundation of the space station is crumbling and the entire structure has fallen into disrepair. The continuous repairing of the space station can not continue and collapse is imminent. To save the inhabitants the starship Agile must design and construct a new space station to support the inhabitants. The new space station is being built in iteration due to the fact that the transfer of inhabitants cannot wait until the new space station is fully complete. But time in running out...



This session will take the basis set forth in Scott Ambler's ""Agile Database Techniques"" book and share the lessons learned, both positive and negative, in the replacement of an Operational Data Store and Data Warehouse in an Agile project. The first part of the session will review the concepts presented in  ""Agile Database Techniques"". The second part of the session will review how the project structured its iterations and how the Operational Data Store and Data Warehouse were designed, iterated, refactored, and deployed.



Special attention will be given to the Data Modeling or Normalization techniques that allowed for a change tolerant design, the Data Architecture design that implemented multiple layers of abstraction and isolation, and the refactoring techniques to evolve the Operational Data Store and Data Warehouse Data Models. Also presented will be the key role of an Enterprise Data Model in an Agile Database project.



Join us for a experience report of how the concepts in ""Agile Database Techniques"" evolved and were customized in a real world Data Warehouse project for a major Health Benefits provider.

"15370","The Stakeholder Management Framework for Teams, Programs, and Portfolios","Stakeholder management is one of the most important responsibilities of a Product Owner.  It can also be one of the biggest land mines if you don't continuously inspect and adapt your planning and communication.  How do you interact with your stakeholders based on their level of interest and the degree of influence the have over your team's success or failure?  



In this session, you will learn how to apply the stakeholder management framework to:     

1. Identify, analyze, prioritize, and engage your stakeholders  

2. Manage expectations through the continuous process of setting expectations, acting on them, reviewing them, and resetting them  

3. Build your communication plan using the stakeholder mapping technique and the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to plot your sponsors, major stakeholders, minor stakeholders, and subject matter experts

Meanwhile Unit Tests are required in order to keep your application clean, functional and Agile.  Until recently these practices were not common on the most popular mobile device in the world, the iPhone, and in this workshop we'll show you how to take the customer's requirements from their brain to executable documentation and take you through the development of a real application.



We will do this through the use of three tools: Fitnesse, OCSlim, and OCDSpec.  Fitnesse is a wiki with a test runner for Slim Tests, that gives instantaneous feedback to the customer when your stories are complete and documents what they do.  OCSlim allows Fitnesse to call into Objective-C, and OCDSpec is the Unit Testing framework for Objective-C that all your friends have been talking about.  In this hands-on workshop you and your pair will implement the game Mastermind from executable specifications, both writing the Unit Tests and the making the Functional Tests green.

"15466","A Starting Point for Negotiations - Delivering with a Heterogeneous Team","Sure, working with a fully cross-functional team where all member's time is 100% on the project is ideal, but we must deliver in the real world of specialization and matrixed personnel.  In this presentation I will describe a methodology that we have developed that allows our Scrum team to consistently predict our capacity and deliver what we promise sprint after sprint, even though our developer's time is fragmented and specialization is to the point where team members have Ph.Ds in various needed disciplines. 



The key to this system is to, before each planning meeting, even though it appears blasphemes at first glance:



* Map individual team member's capacity to story points.

* Estimating the potential sprint backlog's user stories in story points.

* Map developers to user stories.



The reason this approach works, even though it appears to go against the lean principle of self-empowered teams, as well as many others, is a simple phrase we use over and over, ""A starting point for negotiations.""

<!--break-->



I am Scrum Master for a development team at Sandia National Laboratories, one of the three national nuclear weapons Laboratories operated by the United States Government.  Our development team provides computer programs written in C++ that use numerical simulation of physical phenomena (i.e. they solve the mathematical equations that govern natural occurrences such as heat conduction, air flow, and fires) to model the physical environment encountered by nuclear weapon delivery systems.  Our charter is to provide tools which allow designers to deliver safe and functional systems to the nation's stockpile.  Our development team is made up almost entirely of engineer's with Ph.Ds in various disciplines such as Aerospace, Chemical and Mechanical Engineering as well as Physics and Mathematics.



The outline of the presentation is as follows:



* Introduction

* A description of our business space.

* A description of our development team's educational background, time demands, how they measure success, how their success is measured.

* Our methodology, including our reliance on the the philosophy of ""A starting point for negotiations.""

* A critical look at our methodology.

* Criteria for success.

* The tools we use.

* Metrics demonstrating success.

"15518","Hold the Sprinkles! Cupcakes, layers, and Agile UX design requirements","Are you a business analyst working in an Agile environment? Ever feel like you re missing the big picture, focusing on iterations of details? Agile teams can often get caught up in a single product feature, iterating on that one feature to its most complete state. While this approach gives the user fully-fleshed functionality in one area, often the larger workflow is forgotten. We know that a complete and meaningful user experience is important for product success, but prioritizing requirements across the entire user workflow can be challenging.



Using the concepts from Jeff Patton's story mapping exercise, this presentation will show how you can use a layered design approach to create the most valuable end-to-end user experience. <!--break--> Applied at this level, story mapping helps to identify the basic set of requirements for the workflow, and illustrates options for layering enhancements and embellishments. This technique builds on traditional use cases and workflows and adds a visual map to create a complete user experience with the right level of functionality.



Participants will hear examples of how this method has been applied at ProQuest, LLC and learn how to use this simple, effective method to start designing the end-to-end user experience in an Agile way. They will also take away tips for thinking agilely when designing their next project, and they will take away cupcakes.

"15537","Integrating agile with other Enterprise disciplines: Six Sigma, BPM & CM","As Enterprise-level organizations look to maximize the effectiveness of Information Technology and Software Development activities through adoption of agile techniques, it is common that agile development practices may interact or be impacted by other disciplines already entrenched within the Enterprise.



This talk will explore three specific Enterprise disciplines that commonly interact with agile / lean software development:



* Enterprise-level Process Improvement Activities driven through Six Sigma Methodologies (DMAIC, DMADV, Kaizen)



* Business Process Management (BPM)



* Enterprise Configuration Management (CM)





For each discipline, recommended integration patterns will be presented to describe how agile development activities can improve the effectiveness of these common Enterprise disciplines.  <!--break-->Discussion will also outline recommended services that staff supporting each Enterprise discipline (Six Sigma, BPM & CM) should provide to optimize the software delivery and innovation that can be achieved using agile and lean development techniques.  The presentation will also focus on the unique knowledge, skills, abilities, and perspectives that Six Sigma, BPM & CM practitioners have and how often they can integrate with agile development efforts to help teams mitigate specific challenges.  Discussion will highlight specific messaging strategies and patterns to ensure effective collaboration between core agile development staff and staff supporting other Enterprise disciplines.  Lastly, the presentation will provide messaging strategies to deconflict the core activities of agile development from the core activities of Six Sigma, Business Process Management, and Enterprise Configuration Management.



All materials shared during this presentation have been compiled during a 4+ year Enterprise-level change management effort embarked on by a large United Stated Department of Defense organization to adopt agile software development within an Enterprise that was proficient at Six Sigma, BPM and Configuration Management prior to adopting agile.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Enterprise Agile","Lecture","90 minutes","Texas 3","Wednesday 13:30 - 15:00","Jason Tice",,"jason.tice@asolutions.com",,"Practicing"

There are two obvious choices: become the arbitrator who breaks the tie, or throw up your hands in exasperation deciding it's the team's problem. A third, more powerful approach is to become a skilled conflict facilitator. This hands-on workshop provides four interrelated systems intelligence tools and mindsets to help you prevent destructive conflict and encourage the creative kind: the positive/negative ratio, deep democracy perspective, conflict protocols and creating alignment without agreement.



First laying a foundation with the team s positive/negative behavioral ratio, this creates a positive emotional bank account to strengthen resiliency and help people ""assume positive intent."" We then add a behavioral structure, conflict protocols, to prepare teams for the heat of conflict, and finally introduce two core practices (deep democracy and distinguishing  interests  from  positions ) for navigating active conflict as it occurs.

"15558","Dealing with the Counterproductive Games holding back your Agile adoption","Are you encountering impediments to your agile adoption that stem from Individuals and their somewhat unhealthy Interactions? Might any of these relate to people playing games with each other that serve personal interests but are counterproductive to becoming agile? For example: the Blame Game, No Bad News, Token Involvement, Grey Zone ambiguity to avoid responsibility, Social Loafing in group settings, Reverse Doubling of estimates etc. In this session you will use these and other patterns to make  sense of the problematic interpersonal, leadership and estimation games being played in your organisation and those of other participants. You will also explore techniques for reducing or eradicating the counterproductive gameplay that is holding back your ability to be agile.





### Audience



Anyone working to further an agile adoption/transformation in a politically or culturally challenging environment. Especially coaches, ScrumMasters, Project Managers, iteration managers, pro-active team members, line managers, leaders and other change agents.





### Presentation Format



The following mirrors the process/mechanics below with more explaination.



1. Set the Scene - We'll begin with a succinct introduction to what counterproductive games are.

2. Make connections - There will be a selection of game patterns on the walls around the room. Participants will be invited to browse these, and by the end of the time-box position themselves by the one that they connect with most strongly based on their recent experience at work.

3. Story telling - We'll invite participants to share stories about their real-world examples of the game they have clustered around

4. Create shared context - We'll invite participants to decide on one particular real-world example in each cluster and to write a dialogue that best captures the gameplay.

5. Techniques - We'll outline a model for understanding the steps in the game and several techniques for intervening to reduce or eliminate the counterproductive gameplay.

6. Create options for action - We'll invite groups to map out the gameplay, identify opportunities for intervention, discuss and illustrate possible interventions.

7. Debrief - We'll invite participants to reflect and share their experience in the session and what they are taking away from it. 





### Presentation History



* A 1 hour version of this workshop was run at Agile Tour Sydney in December 2011. The feedback for the session was the most positive out of all the sessions at the event. At least one participant personally thanked the facilitator and said it was the most valuable session of the day.

* A 90 minute version of this session is planned for the Agile Sydney community group within the next couple of months.

"15559","Raving Retrospectives -Innovation Gamesﾮ & other techniques to facilitate creative retros","Do you find it challenging to keep your retrospectives innovative and creative so you get the maximum feedback from your scrum team?  This session will review traditional retrospectives and give you 3 new innovative tools to add to your ""tool kit"" to help you facilitate creative, fun and engaging retrospectives. No matter what your project, project methodology or delivery model, everyone benefits from feedback on what they could do differently next time. The session will involve a mix of lecture, workshop and discussion. No death by PowerPoint here!

This session will look at:  

1) What is a retrospective  

2) Why do we do retrospectives  

3) How to plan a retrospective  

4) Traditional retrospectives  

5) Creative retrospectives  



Session attendees will be divided into teams of 6-9 (easily adjustable for audience size) and will do an exercise using one of the following creative retrospective techniques:  

- The Boat (Innovation Gamesﾮ)  

- The Retrospective Starfish  

- Spiderweb Retrospectives  



The audience for this presentation is anyone looking for feedback on how their project, implementation or work is going. Whether from a more traditional environment or a more Agile environment there is something in this session for everyone; from beginners with no retrospective experience to experienced coaches wanting to expand their ""tool box""!



I will use PowerPoint to cover the introduction to retrospectives and why we do them. I will then demonstrate using a white board / flip chart and post it notes some of the traditional retrospective techniques. I will introduce 3 new retrospective techniques and then divide the attendees into groups of 6-9 and have each group try one of the new techniques (easily adjustable for audience size). I will ask them to come up with a topic on which to do a retrospective and I will give them some examples in case they don't have ideas at hand: Agile 2012 Conference Retrospective, iPad 2's, Facebook. After they are done trying their new techniques, we will do a 10 minute debrief with the entire group to discuss why they felt their technique was effective / wasn't effective, what they liked and what they didn't like so that all attendees get feedback on all the techniques.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Collaboration Culture & Teams","Workshop","60 minutes","Texas 3","Wednesday 11:00 - 12:00","Kate Megaw","Brian Rabon","kate.megaw@your-pm-partner.com","brian.rabon@your-pm-partner.com","Practicing"

"15572","SIMPLE METHODS FOR RELIABLE USER INVOLVEMENT","One of the difficult problems faced by an Agile team is that of getting reliable user input. Because Agile projects depend on minimal up-front planning and specification, user feedback is critical. But product owners are rarely users themselves and the actual end-users are often located elsewhere and may be highly diverse. 



This session introduces participants to Contextual Inquiry (CI), a proven field research method for understanding users and their needs. We introduce CI, show how it fits into Agile development, and give participants practice in gathering data and then writing user stories.

"15609","Cultural change with Spiral Dynamics to transform from ""doing agile"" to ""being agile""","Agile software development is no longer the sole domain of little obscure IT companies with their own gurus. Even the most traditional companies are adopting agile methodologies. This is something the agile community has been waiting for for a long time. Finally, recognition! But alas it comes with some drawbacks. 



 Doing Agile  instead of  Being Agile  is one of those drawbacks I keep encountering more and more.  They follow the steps and procedures, but they don t live and breathe Agile and its values , is one of the remarks I get from disillusioned agile coaches. Values don t change overnight by just showing people the agile manifesto and sending them to a two day training. Believe me, we've tried. 



But how can you change the values of individuals and teams or even worse, whole organisations?  That's what this session is about.



Luckily, there is a thing called Spiral Dynamics and it s all about: how people get certain values, why they defend them and how these values evolve over time. Spiral Dynamics is based on 30 years of research done by psychology professor Clare W. Graves. 



With the help of Spiral Dynamics we are going to:  

"" 	Discover the different kinds of Agile implementations based on value systems  

"" 	Recognize them  in our own teams and organisations  

"" 	Know how we can help teams and organisations move from  Doing Agile  to  Being Agile

"15630","Scaling Agile Teams: Principles and Practices","Agile methods depend on effective cross-functional teams. We ve heard many Agile success stories& at the team level. But what happens when a product can t be delivered by one team?  What do you do when the  team  that s needed to work on a particular product is 20 people?  Or 20 teams? 



One response is to create a coordinating role, decompose work, or add layers of hierarchy. Those solutions introduce overhead and often slow down decision making. There are other options to link teams, and ensure communication and integration across many teams.  There are no simple answers. But there are design principles for defining workable arrangements when the product is bigger than a handful of agile teams. 



In this talk, I'll cover principles and practices and explain how they work together to address coordination, integration, and technical integrity.





These are the principles and practices I'll illustrate.



<b>6 Principles:</b>



Manage dependencies in the backlog as much as possible <br>

Aim for long-lived cross-functional teams<br>

Go as far down the technology stack as feasible<br>

Organize teams around context boundaries rather than component boundaries were ever possible<br>

It turns out that our extensive industry experience and past successes couldn't have prepared us for all that we encountered and learned when trying to develop and launch our own consumer startup. We'd like to share what we learned for future teams to benefit!



Oxford Technology Ventures, LLC is a boutique user experience and product strategy consulting firm in New York whose members are seasoned veterans in UX, Internet, and software development. Our clients range from large Fortune 100's to small startups, and we've worked on and helped successfully launch or overhaul hundreds of products and services over the years. 



Like many in the consulting/ agency/ services business, we were feeling ""startup envy"" and wanted go develop and launch our own service. MinIDates.com was initially conceived as a showcase company case study in superior UX, cutting edge mobile tech, and Lean and Agile development processes where we wouldn't be constrained by our clients' preferences, implementation methods, and product direction revisions. We embarked on developing MiniDates.com in January 2011 after several months of conceiving  the product, and ultimately launched it in beta 14 months later- when we had originally thought it would take us only 3-4 months to MVP!  



This session describes the process we went through - what we tried that worked and didn't, what we should have done that we didn't, and what we encountered that we couldn't have foreseen- in the belief that we can help other UX and product-focused startups and Agile teams be more effective practitioners.

Two common challenges we see recurring, even with experienced teams, are (1) they spend far too much time planning and estimating, getting trapped in the details, and (2) they have difficulty finishing user stories in a time-boxed iteration or Sprint   often realizing, despite the promise of further conversation, that they just didn t know enough about the user story before taking it on. This hands-on session introduces participants to two techniques to deal with these problems. The first is Silent Grouping, which allows teams to collaboratively size even very large backlogs in minutes. The second is Definition of Ready, which is a set of agreements that lets everyone know when a user story is ready to begin. Combined, these techniques can save your teams literally hundreds of hours in time.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Agile Boot Camp","Workshop","90 minutes","Texas 3","Tuesday 15:30 - 17:00","Ken Power",,"ken.power@gmail.com",,"Learning"

By focusing on the fundamental unit of work (the baton) a clearer and more concise goal emerges that enables leaders to recognize what and **how** to improve interactions and agility not just from a development perspective but across the entire enterprise.



In 2006, Alistair Cockburn recognized that [the most meaningful unit of work (the baton) within development organizations is  the decision ](http://alistair.cockburn.us/What+engineering+has+in+common+with+manufacturing+and+why+it+matters).  At its core, agility in development (or any knowledge work) is the function an organizations ability to interact in ways that improve decision outcomes and reduce decision delay. Co-location, self-organizing cross functional teams, incremental development, small units of work, and faster feedback loops are all essentially techniques to improve decision flow.  By and large, leaders control the means to affect changes to goals, structure, and culture to improve decision flow between teams and across the organization. 



## Goals



In this tutorial, I'll introduce a set of principles and techniques coaches, leaders, and team members can apply to:



* Increase alignment within the organization around the goal of Agility 

* Identify the greatest opportunities for breakthroughs (and what s holding them back)

* Identify changes to structure and culture that improve decision flow

* Improve the success of Agile adoptions



## Topics include:



* **Learning to see the baton;** - stop focusing on process and start focusing on decisions

* **Deciding to decide well;** - aligning teams and leaders around the goal of decision flow

* **Ask a silly question get a silly answer;** - framing decisions with better questions

* **Survey sez!** - Questions you and your teams should be asking (*but probably aren t*)

* **Decision Deodorant;** -  decision smells and how to refactor them

* **Stop Trying To Hit Me And Hit Me;** -  turn wasted  meeting  time into  deciding  time

* **Stop the madness** - Visualizing decision flows and the bottlenecks that are crippling your teams

* **The care and treatment of organizational SEPsis** ( eliminating inflammatory disease of SEP: *Somebody Else s Problem*)

* **Who has the D?** -  Deciding how to decide more effectively

Large scale (enterprise ) agility often goes beyond a single story and spans  stories and teams.  Story maps are an excellent tool for visualizing cross cutting needs like testing across stories and other challenges that cut across teams. 



Story maps are a simple and excellent tool that foster cross cutting thinking and learning. Along with connecting testers who care about testing that spans stories, story maps are also excellent tools for connecting other cross cutting perspectives: architecture, user experience, sub teams and end user documentation. This session will teach participants to use story maps to address the many challenges that face large scale (enterprise) agility. Participants will work in groups to utilize story maps as tools for situational challenges and realities faced by multi-team and distributed team agile usage.","Option 1: First speaker receives compensation (60/90 Minute)","Enterprise Agile","Workshop","90 minutes","Austin 1-3","Wednesday 13:30 - 15:00","David Hussman",,"david.hussman@devjam.com",,"Practicing"

Such an approach improvesﾠaccountability, eliminates bottlenecks and allows testers to focus on the most complex and difficult testing issues.  However, getting developers engaged in non-code facing testing is often a challenge.



This presentation will detail two techniques - blitz testing and mentored testing, that we've developed at Atlassian that have been highly effective at not only engaging developers to undertake such testing, but also to gain the knowledge and skills they need to improve the quality of the software that they write.



Blitz testing, widens test coverage, and involves regularly assembling an internal  SWAT  team to perform focused testing as a group for short periods. The roles within the group and the structure of the sessions are adapted to suit the various goals of the testing. Mentored testing, deepens test coverage, and involves a tester working directly with a developer to help guide the testing that developers perform, as well as a combination of paired and simultaneous test execution to help developers identify where and how to improve their testing.



Together, these practices result in developers who spend less time fixing their code and testers who are able to focus on complex testing challenges, enabling the team to improve quality without sacrifice.

"15839","Overcoming Traditional Project Release Reporting with an Agile Approach Focused on Change","Overcoming Traditional Project Release Reporting with an Agile Approach Focused on Change

=========================================================================================



Introduction

============



We are a 30 year old product development shop with more than 450 technical people. For years we have been using a traditional approach to the reporting of progress on releases using traditional stage-gate and project management approaches.  The project management approach had been automated to a significant degree and was well entrenched within the organization.  A lot of the standard discussion on release reporting fails to address the legitimate concerns of executive management for this large a development group as it focuses on team rather than the organization needs.  If not addressed this creates resistance to the adoption of Scrum / Agile which, given all the other cultural issues that need to be addressed could seriously distract and even jeopardize the implementation.  What is required is an approach which maintains the integrity of the Scrum team approach while still providing data to the business that allows them to make decisions.



When I say ""traditional"" reporting, what am I talking about?  I am talking about weekly schedules meetings to determine whether we are all on track, Microsoft Project based schedules with standard stage gates for approvals, pages and pages of documentation on current status, data held privately to the development shop and so on.



When I say ""maintains the integrity of Scrum team approach"" what am I talking about?  I am talking about team based estimates using points, simple encoding on user stories to allow categorization of data, roll-up reporting to generate release and portfolio views from team views and a set of 5 simple reports that really do provide everything that everyone needs.



Principles of Reporting

=======================



The session explores the following general principles of release reporting and provides specific examples of use.



* Make everything (I really mean this) available to everyone in the organization.

* Make sure that reporting can be done simply, with no additional work required by the teams, and using simple approaches to categorize data.

* Base release reporting on changes that we are seeing in the progress of the release project as opposed to reporting on the plan so that everyone can understand the current state of the plan.

* Ensure that reports are the same at all levels (team, product release, portfolio), based on the same information (team based estimates and velocity) and producing the same results so that everyone is looking at their view of the same data.

* Ensure that you interview ""C"" levels in your organization to understand their areas of interest in the reporting so that, again, everyone is looking at the same data and making their decisions by the same criteria.

* Ensure there is a continuum of reporting that not only helps with business but more importantly helps the teams so that the data required by the business are a natural by-product of normal team work.



Questions

=========



How did you uniquely scale, blend, adapt or evolve agile practices?

-------------------------------------------------------------------



Starting with the basic ""release burn-up"" chart sourced from team data (story point estimates and velocity), we developed and sold internally the notion that five simple reports would give us everything we need to run the business:



* Release burn-up, with trend-lines: ""I, as a Scrum Product Owner who is trying to optimize the delivery of a product release in terms of date, scope, and cost need a way to show what the current scope in the release and progress we are making toward it so that we can make well-informed trade-offs and commitments based on the reality of our company's capabilities.""

* Scope change report: ""I, as a Scrum Product Owner who wants to communicate with the stakeholders need a way to show how the work for a release has changed from the original baseline to the current status so that everyone is really informed about the current status of the plan.""

* Epic progress report: ""I, as a Scrum Product Owner who wants to understand the status of the release need a way to show how work is progressing against the major epics of the release so that I can make adjustments in the plan based on completion of these epics.""

* Investment allocation report: ""I, as a Scrum Product Owner who wants to make good investment decisions need a way to show how work is split in terms of the basic investment categories management report against so that I can make predictions for future plans based on history and make adjustments during execution of a release when these assumptions do not work out.""

* Project allocation report: ""I, as a Scrum Product Owner who wants to make good investment decisions need a way to show how work is split in terms of the next release and existing fielded releases the Scrum Team is working on so that I can make predictions for future plans based on history and make adjustments during execution of a release when these assumptions do not work out.""



The only adjustments required to produce the reports were some simple attribution on the user stories which the Product Owners were glad to do since it gave them the information that they could use.



What mistakes did you make? What insights have you gained that others need to know about?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The biggest mistake I made was underestimating the amount of inertia associated with the traditional reporting model.  What I should have done was simply tackle this issue much earlier.  If I had done this I suspect that there would have been less managerial resistance to the adoption of agile.  A second mistake I made was not supplying better templates to produce the information required.  This lead to confusing when amongst the people that wanted to do this reporting since they virtually had to learn how to do it themselves.



What was it like integrating agile development into to the rest of your organization?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The issue of release reporting became an impediment.  I used to think ""those management people just do not understand the whole 'agile' concept.""  I thought they wanted project reporting against ""the plan.""  I found out they did have legitimate concerns that we were not addressing.  What they actually wanted was standardize reporting that answered key questions about ""where are we"", ""are we heading in the right direction"", ""when do we expect something"", ""what decisions need to be made today"" and so on.  While I am sure they would have liked to have a predictable plan, it was my understanding that they were asking for traditional reporting.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  By taking the time to understand the requirements (capturing them as user stories) I could take the issue off the table which meant that we ended up with a smoother transition.



How successful were you in overcoming challenges? What challenges remain?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The main challenge that remains is moving to this work to a tool so that we can automate the process.  We have sold the concepts, are producing the reports manually but it is taking time when it should be easy to automate.



If you ve been doing agile development for some time, how have your values or ways of working changed? What are you doing now and why?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Lesson learned - don't let your assumptions about others lead you to thinking that you understand everything.  As an agile coach you can easily fall into the trap of hubris.

Agile teams are cross-functional teams that promote sharing of project-specific knowledge through frequent face-to-face interaction, effective communication and customer collaboration. Knowledge sharing is difficult for distributed Agile teams due to spatial, temporal, and cultural barriers, which negatively affect face-to-face interaction, communication and collaboration. There seems to be very few studies that focus on knowledge management in distributed Agile teams. Through a Grounded Theory study that involved 45 participants from 28 different software companies in the USA, India and Australia, we investigate distributed software development from the specific perspective of Agile teams. In this paper, we describe how Agile teams gather, store, share and use knowledge in distributed software development.","30 Min Accept (Insights/Research only - One Option Only)","Research at Work","Lecture","30 minutes","Ft.

However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the  goodness  of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the  goodness  of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method s effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice. In this paper, we discuss our solution approach, preliminary results, and future work.

However, the terminology used to describe the field   as well as the evidence in existing literature   is largely inconsistent. In order to better structure our understanding of the field and to guide future work, we conducted a systematic mapping of agile testing. We investigate five research questions: which authors are most active in agile testing; what is agile testing used for; what types of paper tend to be published in this field; how do practitioners and academics contribute to research in this field; and what tools are used to conduct agile testing? Of particular interest is our investigation into the source of these publications, which indicates that academics and practitioners focus on different types of publication and, disturbingly, that the number of practitioner papers in the sources we searched is strongly down since 2010.

"16693","User Experience Design Goes Agile in Lean Transformation   A Case Study","This paper describes the results of a single-case case study, exploring the role of user experience (UX) work in agile software development. The case study company is a large multinational telecommunication company undergoing a lean transformation process. In this case, lean transformation includes the adoption of agile software development practices. Transformation to agile practices had taken place one year prior to the analysis. The analysis is based on documentation analysis and semi-structured interviews of seven software development professionals. The results show that there were difficulties integrating UX design and software engineering work in an agile and iterative manner. The transition process succeeded in shifting UX and related documentation to a central planning role. The roles of the UX designers in the teams were still under re-definition. There was also a clear need to establish new ways of collaboration between UX professionals and software designers.

"16694","Estimate of the appropriate iteration length in agile development by conducting simulation","""Agile development refers to the group of software development methodologies based on an iterative and incremental process model. It divides the development period into short time frames called iterations and uses a body of knowledge obtained from past experience called practice to ensure agile software development Although the iteration length is an important factor in agile development however it has so far been decided by the qualitatively and it has been reported that projects with an inappropriate iteration length are more preme to failure. 

We thus propose a new methodology for estimating an appropriate iteration length through the conduct on of a simulation based on project constraints. 

In this study we first, propose a method of calculating an appropriate iteration length for a particular project to promote the easy use of agile development. 

Second, the relationship between the iteration length and project constraints was investigated by varying the parameters to create diverse situations. ""

"16695","Agile Development and User Experience Design Integration as an On-going Achievement in Pra","Little is known about how Agile developers and UX designers integrate their work on a day-to-day basis. While accounts in the literature attempt to integrate Agile development and UX design by combining their processes and tools, the contradicting claims found in the accounts complicate extracting advice from such accounts. This paper reports on three ethnographically-informed field studies of the day-to-day practice of developers and designers in organisational settings. Our results show that integration is achieved in practice through (1) mutual awareness, (2) expectations about acceptable behaviour, (3) negotiating progress and (4) engaging with each other. Successful integration relies on practices that support and maintain these four aspects in the day-to-day work of developers and designers.

"16696","Documentation Work in Agile Teams: The Role of Documentation Formalism in Achieving a Sust","As its second guiding principle, agile software development promotes working software over comprehensive documentation. In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation. We found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members. Consequently, this hampered collaboration within the team. Based in our findings, we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project, producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product. Furthermore, we argue that codification of internal development knowledge should be a non-intrusive task.
