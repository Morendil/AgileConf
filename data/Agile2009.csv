266,"How to be really awesome at Continuous Integration.","Continuous Integration is a key practice in the agile toolkit.  The practice is pretty simple - when checkins occur, some process is run against the codebase. This usually includes compilation and unit tests, but could include all sorts of things. 

The panel of CI experts host discussion of the audience's problems, questions, concerns and ideas about how to make best use of CI.

We aim to draw together the experience of the panel with the enthusiasm and fresh eyes of the participants to share our collective CI knowledge with those having issues with their CI implementations.

403,"Ugly Code vs Clean Code: A/B Comparison of Legacy/Test-Driven Implementations","The instructors wish, when they were first learning test-driving, refactoring, and OO, that they had had a side-by-side comparison between code Heaven and code Hell. Such an object lesson would have made the value and benefits of agile programming practices so much more plain, so much sooner. Alas for us, but hurray for you! In this workshop you will be able to compare and work with two very different implementations of the same problem domain: one of them fabulously ugly, and the other of them â€” well â€” a lot better. This is a close-repeat of a successful session we gave at Agile 08.

1097,"What is an Agile Project Manager anyway?","Project Managers comprise the single largest category of agile practitioners that are actively engaged in the industry (18%). However, there is no clear consensus on the role of project manager within the Agile community.  Viewpoints range from:
â€¢ The PM is complete waste. 
â€¢ The PM is a necessary part-time helper.
â€¢ The PM is a crucial communicator and facilitator.

2043,"Build Engineer Bootcamp:  Builds As Code","Bad build practices take a hidden toll on teams. It is not uncommon for a new developer to take days or even weeks to establish a functioning workspace. Good build engineers can make all the difference. By treating the build framework with the same respect as other source code they can help prevent these problems. In this clinic we will show how to refactor your build approach to end up with sustainable practices that get new people up and running quickly and set the stage for long term productivity.

Provide the participants with a hands-on-experience of real world refactoring by taking an open source project and refactoring it.

**Summary** 

Refactoring is a very well established practice not just in the Agile Community, but outside as well.

91,"Applying modern software development techniques to automating the web UI","In today's Agile development environment, UI testing is still very much done the old way.  We still see long scripts that are easily broken and impossible to maintain.  By applying modern software development techniques like test first development, refactoring, and pair programming we can seek to make better tests that are less fragile and more likely to discover defects in code.  In this session we will demonstrate the techniques listed above and discuss how they can be applied to UI testing.  The demonstration will use a combination of fitnesse and SWAT (an open source web UI testing tool).","Testing","Demonstration","45 minutes","Tara the Tester","David the Agile Developer, Deanna the User Interface Designer, Peter the Programmer","Gold West","Regency D","Thursday 11:00-11:45",1,"Michael  Longin","Christopher Taylor","Michael_longin@ultimatesoftware.com","christopher_taylor@ultimatesoftware.com",1
104,"Transition Testing: Cornerstone of Database Agility","In this session, you will learn one thing: how to enable emergent design in a database.  The reality is that databases development is different from application code development.  They are similar, but databases bring about some forces that we havenâ€™t given much thought.

This session challenges traditional, foundational database development techniques and proposes a new framework into which Agile processes, as well techniques such as TDD or refactoring, can better fit.

399,"Automated deployment with Maven and friends - going the whole nine yards","Automating your build process with Continuous Integration is certainly a great idea, but why stop there? Why not go the whole nine yards and automate the deployment process as well? Staging and production deployments are typically more complicated and more involved than a simple development deployment, but doing them by hand can be time-consuming, tricky and error-prone. Indeed, turning your staging and production deployments into a one-click affair has a lot going for it.","Tools for Agility","Demonstration","90 minutes","David the Agile Developer","Garrett the Guru, Patricia the Project Manager ","Gold East","Grand Ballroom E","Wednesday 11:00-11:45, Wednesday 11:45-12:30",3,"John Smart",,"john.smart@wakaleo.com",,1

In this session, we will go through the full process of setting up an automated software development infrastructure, from code changes and version control right through to automated deployment to staging and production. We will go through the key steps involved in automating a typical Java project using Maven, Hudson and a large cast of other supporting tools. We will see not only how to automate the build itself, but also how to improve code quality, manage releases, and improve team communication.","Tools for Agility","Demonstration","180 minutes","David the Agile Developer","Alex the Architect, Garrett the Guru, Patricia the Project Manager","Gold East","Grand Ballroom E","Thursday 14:00-14:45, Thursday 14:45-15:30, Thursday 16:00-16:45, Thursday 16:45-17:30",3,"John Smart",,"john.smart@wakaleo.com",,1
572,"CI vendor cage-fight!","In this session, we invite CI tool vendors to give a short demonstration of the best features of their tool. Each vendor will be given 10min to show off the best features of their software, with a further 5min of questions. 

This will allow CI users to quickly get a good grasp on the plethora of CI tools on the market, to help them find out about useful features of various tools that may help their CI implementation, and to learn about the practices that each tool encourages. 

It also helps CI tool vendors gauge the market, and improve the standards and features of all CI products.","Tools for Agility","Demonstration","90 minutes","David the Agile Developer","Carlos the Internal Coach, Chandra the Consultant, Ellie the Agile Explorer","Gold East","Grand Ballroom E","Thursday 11:00-11:45, Thursday 11:45-12:30",2,"Tom Sulston",,"tom@sulston.net",,1
641,"Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) in Practice","Agile teams practicing Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) define acceptance tests collaboratively while discussing each story. This practice helps uncover assumptions and confirm that everyone has a shared understanding of ""Done"". During implementation, the technical team automates the natural-language Acceptance Tests by writing code to wire them to the emerging software. In this way, ATDD tests become executable requirements. This session is a demo of the full ATDD workflow from initial discussions to distilling tests into an automatable format to implementing code to the final demo.","Main Stage","Demonstration","90 minutes","Tara the Tester","Billy the Business Analyst, Carlos the Internal Coach, David the Agile Developer","Green West","Crystal B","Tuesday 16:00-16:45, Tuesday 16:45-17:30",1,"Pekka KlÃ¤rck","Elisabeth Hendrickson","esh@qualitytree.com","peke@iki.fi",1
712,"Continuous Testing Evolved","Continuous Testing (CT) is a developer practice that shortens the feedback loop established by Test Driven Development. It gives you near instant feedback about the correctness of your code, and helps you find bugs as quickly as syntax errors. This session will cover how CT has evolved in the last year, it's current capabilities, and limitations.  The presenters will also show several demos of the practice using freely available continuous testing tools, and examine how these tools can be integrated with existing infrastructure to bring the benefits of CT to a wider audience.

713,"Test Driven Development in Java: Live and Uncensored","One of the barriers to wider adoption of TDD is that it is best taught from within a team, and the technical challenges of writing tests frequently thwart those looking to teach themselves. This session will be a live demonstration of Test Driven Development in Java, using Eclipse and JUnit, aimed at those new to TDD and looking to learn. Audience members will be encouraged to follow along on their own laptops as we walk through common scenarios that frequently discourage new TDDers, and demonstrate some techniques for overcoming them in a live coding session.","New to Agile","Demonstration","90 minutes","Rubin the Reluctant Agilist","Ellie the Agile Explorer, Peter the Programmer, Tara the Tester","Gold East","Grand Ballroom B","Thursday 11:00-11:45, Thursday 11:45-12:30",2,"Ben Rady",,"benrady@gmail.com",,1
967,"Ineffective Pairing, How To","Most sessions show us how to do various agile practices right. What is sorely lacking is the opportunity to learn how to do the practices wrong. How can we be expected to bring agile into an organization successfully without mastery of that key skill?

Pairing isn't controversial, done effectively it:
* reduces defects (by up to 86%, according to the 2000 University of Utah study), 
* improves productivity (up to three-fold, according to the 1975 US Army study)

However, learning by doing wrong is actually an effective learning technique, and that's what you'll see here.

1125,"Continuous Integration of the World","Ok, maybe we exaggerated a bit. CI deployments focus on the testing and deployment of the application. The 'world' (OS, Application & DB server) within a CI doesnâ€™t change that much. But what if you could define your applications environment from a kind of â€˜sourceâ€™ and build and unit test it? f.i. Test security patches by using unit tests of your application?

Using the concept of a pipeline we will show how to use existing tools/concepts for a Continuous Build for your Infrastructure allowing you to better integrate your production environment.

This lead to many more benefits that we didn't expect. It also minimized the overhead costs of extracting, introducing and maintaining new modules. This provided a path for us to move away from a few monolithic slow builds to many small, lightweight fast builds.  Using conventions improved cross-team communication.

736,"Strategies for replacing systems in agile projects","In replacement projects one of the biggest questions is what strategy to use in replacing the old system. The simplest strategy is to wait until the new system is ""at least as good as the old one"" before switching. Although this strategy sounds compelling it has many serious drawbacks.

> How can we increase velocity?

Many teams have had to answer this question, but is it the right question? Velocity is an excellent measurement for determining project timelines and progress towards them but doesn't give us any indication about the overall value of the features being delivered. All too often poor prioritization and solutioning are ignored because velocity is the KPI for the team. This session shows how to use value as a tool to ensure that you get more of the right things done.

It does not mean doing what you are good at; it means challenging yourself under the guidance of a teacher. Unfortunately, our organizations are not set up to develop experts, nor do agile practices encourage them. So how will we develop the experts we need to improve?  Maria is a software development manager at a company that manufactures steel. Her job is to guide the professional development of a hundred people while reorganizing the way software is developed in her organization.

It will flow all by itself, and work will flow much faster and much more reliably than it could possibly follow a schedule. But take a closer look at that workflow: Just when you thought it was obsolete, the V model reappears.

Many practices work to different degrees of success depending on exactly how they're implemented. We'll discuss why this is so, with examples of multiple ways to do pair programming, testing, and planning. Along the way, we'll show some new work: how to get a better plan by not estimating, models to identify which practices to experiment on, and how to find what to vary.

Using examples, we'll see that Scala is statically-typed, yet it has a succinct and flexible syntax. Scala _traits_ add _mixin composition_ to Java's object model. Scala fully supports _functional programming_, which is the best approach for robust concurrent applications. All these qualities improve our agility.

Too much testing can lead to backlash, gridlock, morale problems, and poor velocity.  Of course lack of testing can lead to bad design, gridlock, morale problems, and poor velocity.

Liskov Substitution Principle and the Dependency Inversion Principle are just two of the principles that are easily learned through TDD.

A high-performing agile team is tight knit. They have worked hard to become a cohesive unit and have developed a bond.

If they have not been involved in the care and nurturing of the teamâ€™s culture and is not invested in the same way that the other team members are.

2444,"Powerful Questions: Human-centric coaching","Human relationships are at the center of the Agile manifesto. Anything we do as coaches to allow humanity expression in our teams directly affects the individuals' ability to live the manifesto more fully. This immediately translates into better, more astonishing, creation-ability in teams, and a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment for the team members.  In this session, experienced coaches/trainers Lyssa Adkins and Tobias Mayer will introduce 'Powerful Questions' and share their personal experiences of coaching teams and individuals towards a more human-centric way of working.

2450,"Help me to see... corporate culture","Changing the way individuals and teams work is one thing. Changing organizational culture is quite another, especially when so many of us (yes, even us at this conference) have little idea that the assumptions we make, the language we use, the structures we are bound by are the direct antithesis of Agile. Our thinking is locked by the patterns of years and needs to be unleashed in order to make inroads towards cultural change. Using a simple yet effective collaboration game from the Improv tradition this session will challenge our assumptions and open up new neural pathways. It is a beginning.","Agile & Organizational Culture","Workshop","90 minutes","Carlos the Internal Coach","Brooke the Business Executive, Chandra the Consultant, Ellie the Agile Explorer","Gold West","Atlanta","Wednesday 11:00-11:45, Wednesday 11:45-12:30",1,"Alan Cyment","Tobias Mayer","acyment@gmail.com","tobias@agilethinking.net",1
2473,"May the Forces Be With You, Exploring the Forces Driving and Restraining Agile","Understanding the forces driving and restraining the adoption of Agile in your organization is key to your success.  This audience participation workshop creates two teams, the Drivers and the Restrainers and has them present the forces at work in the most original and humorous way possible.

This results in a lot of fun and learning.

The workshop will be led by two experienced coaches to bring out the subtle details of the forces and lead the discussion on how to improve the success given the forces at work.","Agile Adoption","Workshop","90 minutes","Carlos the Internal Coach","Brooke the Business Executive, David the Agile Developer, Ellie the Agile Explorer","Gold West","Regency C","Thursday 11:00-11:45, Thursday 11:45-12:30",1,"Rod Claar","Douglas Shimp","rodclaar@effectiveagiledev.com","doug.shimp@3back.com",1

2562,"Many paths to the top of the (mobile) mountain","As the internet proliferates beyond the PC to myriad devices - from iPhone to smart-phone - anyone delivering digital products deals with complexity: varying form factors, cultural differences and contexts of use. In this workshop we explore the implications of this complexity, discover through collaborative experience where the pain points lie, and identify strategies for dealing with them. We conclude that the unique challenges faced in the design and development of mobile applications benefit from agile software development and its ability to cope with such complexity.","User Experience","Workshop","90 minutes","Deanna the User Interface Designer","David the Agile Developer, Padma the Struggling Product Owner, Parker the Product Manager ","Gold East","Columbus KL","Thursday 14:00-14:45, Thursday 14:45-15:30",1,"Tom Hume","Johanna Hunt","Tom.Hume@futureplatforms.com","j.m.hunt@sussex.ac.uk",1
2621,"A Traditional Test Managers' Support Group for Adopting Agility","So much of moving traditional test teams towards agile methods & testing is focused towards the individual tester and testing techniques. As often is the case in agility--directors, managers, team leaders and test-centric project managers are sort of marginalized. But not in this session! Here we want to focus on agile testing from the perspective of the Test Leader. We'll pair off into groups and examine some of the greatest challenges when it comes to leading a testing team from traditional towards agile testing and emerge real-world strategies for surviving and thriving in agile testing.

2794,"Improving the Quality of Your Dialogues ","The ability to engage in positive and productive dialogue is critical for team learning and agile team success.  Come join us for a lively discussion on how to improve the quality of dialogue in your workplace. We'll use a specific dialogue format called World CafÃ© to explore the many factors that influence dialogue quality. In World CafÃ©, small groups discuss specific questions and move around in a specific way to cross-pollinate ideas and synthesize collective wisdom. Topics will include the power of questions, levels of listening, and stages of dialogue.","Leadership & Teams","Workshop","90 minutes","Carlos the Internal Coach","Brooke the Business Executive, Chandra the Consultant, Marcus the Program Manager","Gold West","Regency A","Monday 16:00-16:45, Monday 16:45-17:30",1,"Eric Babinet",,"ebabinet@salesforce.com",,1
2800,"Creating a Culture of Trust: An Agile Leadersip Tool","In our business and personal lives, many of us know leaders who foster environments with incredible creativity, innovation, and ideasâ€”while other leaders try but fail. So, how do top leaders get it right? This session explores ways that leaders create cultures of trust that fosters the free flow of ideas. While we canâ€™t make people trust each other, a culture of trust gives empowerment and provides a safe place to explore and discover new and innovative solutions and new ways of implementing and reaching results. It also encourages healthy risk taking to fail early and correct faster.","Agile & Organizational Culture","Workshop","90 minutes","Other","Billy the Business Analyst, Brooke the Business Executive, Carlos the Internal Coach","Gold West","Regency D","Wednesday 14:00-14:45, Wednesday 14:45-15:30",2,"Pollyanna Pixton",,"p2@ppixton.com",,1
2817,"Stepping Up and Stepping Back: The Leadership Tipping Point","Leaders can stifle progress when they unnecessarily interfere with team processes. However, as a leader, you donâ€™t want your project to go over the cliff and fail miserably or deliver the wrong results either. There are times when leaders should stand back and let the team work things out for themselvesâ€”and other times when leaders should step up and really lead. How do you know which is which? And what do you do to not stifle the teamâ€™s creativity, ownership, integrity, and problem solving ability? Come away with tools to both motivate and guide teams and organizations effectively.","Leadership & Teams","Workshop","90 minutes","Other","Billy the Business Analyst, Brooke the Business Executive, Carlos the Internal Coach ","Gold West","Regency A","Wednesday 09:00-09:45, Wednesday 09:45-10:30",2,"Pollyanna Pixton",,"p2@ppixton.com",,1
2839,"Do I Still Have a Job? Roles and Org Structure in an Agile Transition","As an organization becomes more agile, people often worry about the future of their jobs.  If detailed requirements documents aren't needed anymore, what happens to a business analyst?  If people aren't constantly shuffling from one project to another, what does a program manager do?  If testers are part of scrum teams, how can a QA lead increase quality?  In this workshop, participants will explore how different roles change during an agile transition, envision new roles for everyone, and discuss strategies for change that help address the fears that often prevent successful agile adoption.","Agile Adoption","Workshop","180 minutes","Carlos the Internal Coach","Billy the Business Analyst, Chandra the Consultant, Garrett the Guru","Gold West","Regency C","Tuesday 14:00-14:45, Tuesday 14:45-15:30, Tuesday 16:00-16:45, Tuesday 16:45-17:30",1,"Alex Pukinskis","Mark Kilby","alexpukinskis@gmail.com","mckilby@gmail.com",1
2989,"First, Kill All The Metrics!","How well are we served by our current metrics? Do metrics such as developer and tester productivity, ROI, and on-time / on-budget help us improve results? Or, do such metrics drive us towards negative behaviors?
In this workshop, we describe the foundation for meaningful metrics. Workshop participants, via a series of exercises, translate this foundation into metrics that they can immediately use. 
This workshop results from the response I received during my Agile 2008 presentation on the CIO and agile teams. There was a great deal of interest on the topic of aligned, meaningful metrics.

3047,"Beyond features: How to listen to your customers and learn what they really need","Successful software products deliver a set of features your customers' value and will pay for. To determine the correct priority and presentation of features, it's important to understand the different behaviors and attitudes that exist in the audience for your product. Ethnographic field research is very valuable, yet can be expensive, time consuming and require skilled researchers. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn how to use collaborative play with customers to discover how they think and what they value, and use this intelligence effectively with your agile teams.

3080,"Why Is Testing So Slow?  ","Why is testing so slow?  Why is testing taking so long?  We've done lots of things to speed up testing, but we still face this time crunch when we get to the end of the iteration; then we find out from the field that there are problems that we didn't anticipate.  In this workshop, we'll gather familiar patterns that slow down testing, and discover a few more in the process--and maybe we'll find that the slowest parts of testing have nothing to do with testing at all.  If you have problems that you'd like to solve or solutions that you'd like to offer, come along.","Testing","Workshop","90 minutes","Patricia the Project Manager ","Billy the Business Analyst, Ellie the Agile Explorer, Marcus the Program Manager","Gold East","Grand Ballroom D North","Thursday 09:00-09:45, Thursday 09:45-10:30",1,"Michael Bolton",,"mb@michaelbolton.net",,1
3205,"Where Does Developer Testing End and Tester Testing Begin?","This is a trick question, right? In agile, everyone works on the same items together, at the same time. Yet, the reality is weâ€™re not all interchangeable cogs. Developers and testers each bring their own, unique skills to the table. The key to effective agile is not minimizing our differences, but building upon the strengths each person brings to the team.  Join us for this hands-on simulation and retrospective as developers and testers explore how agile teams build quality into their process, how each member contributes to that quality, and how we can avoid traditional testing pitfalls.","Testing","Workshop","90 minutes","Tara the Tester","David the Agile Developer, Patricia the Project Manager , Peter the Programmer","Gold East","Grand Ballroom D North","Monday 14:00-14:45, Monday 14:45-15:30",1,"Abby Fichtner","Nate Oster","haxrchick@gmail.com","oster.nate@gmail.com",1
