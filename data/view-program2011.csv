"8716","Lean UX: Getting out of the deliverables business","Traditionally UX Design has been a deliverables practice. Wireframes, sitemaps, etc defined the practice of UX Design (IA, IxD, UI Design etc). While this work has helped define what a UX Designer does and their value, it has also put designers in the deliverables business   measured & compensated for the quality of their deliverables (instead of the success of the experiences they design).\n\nEnter Lean UX - the practice of bringing the experience to light faster, with less emphasis on deliverables and greater focus on the actual experience being designed.\n","User Experience & Interaction Design","Talk","60 minutes","LA: Arizona Room","Thursday 15:30 - 16:30","Jeff Gothelf","","jeff@jeffgothelf.com","","Practicing"
"8736","Critical Success Factors for Acceptance Test Driven Dev't","A good analyst knows what questions to ask to bring clarity to a murky subject. When they hear about Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), a core practice on Agile projects, they ask: ""Can examples capture functional requirements?, Where do user stories come from?, and Will my role become extinct? . When Jennitta Andrea worked on her first Agile project in 2000, she asked all of these questions and more. As a hands-on practitioner and keen observer of teams and processes, she has discovered success comes from knowing how ATDD is part of an eco-system of roles, practices, and tools.

In this tutorial we look at the original reasons for BDD, returning the focus to the language and conversations at its heart. We look at how BDD s patterns can be applied at multiple scales, from the initial project vision all the way to the code, to deliberately discover and address ignorance in every aspect of software development.","Working with Customers","Tutorial","180 minutes","LA: Grand Ballroom B","Monday 13:30 - 17:00","Elizabeth Keogh","Katherine Kirk","liz@lunivore.com","katherinekirk@hotmail.com","Introductory"

But, why avoid a dependency that creates business value such as reusing customer information across products? Why add yet another framework which would increase the technical debt when there is one suitable already there?\n\nThis workshop will provide and refine a framework and practices to identify and manage the dependencies that truly create value while avoiding those that don't. This will ensure a more constructive way of dealing with dependencies.","Enterprise Agile","Workshop","90 minutes","GA: Imperial Ballroom C","Tuesday 13:30 - 15:00","Sonya Lowry","Lars Skaar","SonyaLowry@gmail.com","lars.skar@gmail.com","Practicing"
