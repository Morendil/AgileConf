93	THE CURRENT CONVERSATION IN AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT	Every 3-6 months, the conversation around the term "agile software\ndevelopment" changes. First it was, "What is 'agile'?", then "How do I do\n'agile'?", then it went to "How can / cannot 'agile' coexist or be mixed\nwith plan-centric approaches?" As of May (2002), the conversation was:\n"Contrast project strategies if the project's dominant priority is agility, or\nlaid-backness, or fun, or cost, or predictability." In this invited talk,\nAlistair Cockburn will describe the dominant conversation he is involved\nwith at the time of the conference. Current prediction has it that the May 2002\ntheme will still be current in early August.	Main conference	Featured Talk	2002
94	"You say you want a revolution ... "	XP/Agile are "revolutionary" approaches to software development.  The\nlatest in a distinguished lineage of such innovations.  A revolutionary\ninnovation does not, however, a revolution make.  What forces are at\nwork that will prevent XP/Agile from becoming truly revolutionary?  How\nmight the revolution be won?  Within the context of these questions we\nwill explore a bit of history, cultural anthropology, mysticism, and\nMaoism and outline future strategy.	Main conference	Featured Talk	2002
95	Triggers and Practice: How Extremes in Writing Relate to Creativity and Learning 	Several XP principles are used by creative writers all the time. Creative\nwriting is about exploration and learning. In this talk I examine the\nrelationships between learning and making things. We will see that\neverything worth anything is extreme.

97	EDUCATOR SYMPOSIUM:  EXTREME TEACHING -- AN AGILE APPROACH TO EDUCATION	Extreme Programming is built around core values, principles, and practices designed to align the experience of developing software with reality. You can set out to design your application with the assumption that you can anticipate all issues that will arise in a world of static requirements. What do you do when you come across an unforeseen problem or when the requirements change over time? What happens when new and better solutions become apparent in the course of development? Similarly, as instructors, we begin each new term armed with a syllabus and an idea of how the course will run. Then reality rears its ugly head. The software that was supposed to be installed in the lab for the first day of classes isn't installed. The textbook looked better when you evaluated it last spring than it does now that you are actually trying to teach from it. The students are either much quicker, much slower, or much more diverse than you anticipated. In this workshop we'll begin the process of selecting core values, principles, and practices that we can use to guide us in the classroom the same way that XP can help guide developers. We do not expect the practices of XP to map over. On the other hand, as an example, much of XP benefits from quick, accurate feedback. Several of the practices are based around this idea. Quick, accurate feedback obviously applies in the classroom as well and may suggest other values, principles, or practices.	Main conference	Workshop	2002

101	Agile Software Development and the Rational Unified Process(r)	There are some basic principles and values that make a software development project, or process, agile. Using the agile values and principles, we look at how a process framework such as the Rational Unified Process (r) can be configured to be agile. The presentation is based on examining a specific configuration of RUP and how it supports the agile characteristics. We look at common misconceptions about a process like the RUP, and show that most of the problems come from the different words used to describe the process, and the misapplication of the process.\nWe examine how a framework can be used to grow with a project and organization by providing a consistent set of best practices that may be applied as needed. All you need to do is add a healthy dose of common sense.	Main conference	Special Presentation	2002
102	FEATURES, USER STORIES, AND USE CASES: GATHERING REQUIREMENTS IN AN AGILE PROCESS	Choosing the right requirements vehicle can affect the dynamics of your software development process. Use cases continue to dominate the enterprise while features and user stories are gathering momentum. But which vehicle is right for your project? How can Feature-Driven Development and other agile processes be adapted to use other requirements vehicles? This presentation examines the changing dynamics of the use case, the value of the user story beyond extreme programming, and the increasing role of features in the development of software.\nGranville Miller\nSenior Technical Product Manager, TogetherSoft\nGranville has over a decade of experience in the object-oriented community.

115	Using Risk to Balance Agility and Discipline 	At the USC Center for Software Engineering we have found that risk analysis is a good way to address "how much is enough?"  questions for a given project situation.  This enables you to balance a project's mix of agility and discipline by considering the risks of having too little or too much of each.  I will illustrate this on several projects situations, show some ways in which hybrid agile and disciplined methods can be combined, and discuss the results of some recent workshops which have addressed this question.

116	XP IN A LEGACY ENVIRONMENT	Summary \n        Extreme Programming is not just for the lucky few projects where applications \n        are built from scratch. Learn how XP's practices can be brought to bear \n        on a poorly designed and untested legacy code base in need of salvation. \n        The audience will operate on a J2EE version of the famous "Bowling \n        Score" application, developed under a waterfall methodology and set \n        within a living environment populated with convincingly nervous clients. \n        Duration: Full day Background\n        To implement new functionality and better usability on legacy systems, \n        XP practitioners must begin with a "recovery and stabilization" \n        phase, in which they erect the scaffolding of unit tests, continuous integration, \n        and other technical infrastructure essential to supporting XP's central \n        value of courage. Of course, this is easier said than done, because the \n        code was never designed to be unit-tested, and there is no continuous \n        integration. To top it all off, the client needs new functionality soon, \n        in order to realize their ROI, and the user interface needs to be overhauled \n        to meet basic standards of usability. How can all of this be accomplished \n        while managing risk?By completing this hands-on interactive tutorial, \n        participants will learn how to:  Structure technical infrastructure tasks within the overall release \n        plan.  Identify which XP practices can be implemented immediately on legacy \n        code systems, and which ones must be gradually introduced.  Use techniques for coping while XP practices are only partly implemented. \n         Establish when and how to proceed to deep information-flow refactoring \n        as the XP support infrastructure comes online.  Improve the legacy code base so that new functionality can safely \n        be added. Enhance the usability and user interface of the application \n        with minimal risk. \n        AudienceContent Outline\n       PrologueThe journey begins…\n          Participants will be introduced to a land under siege by a beastly application, \n          and an intrepid tribe of developers fearing for their livelihoods. These \n          are dangerous times, indeed. Chapter I: Hunting the Beast Scouring the land in search of the monster…\n          Using a legacy implementation of the ubiquitous "Bowling Score" \n          application as a J2EE project on the brink of failure, participants \n          will probe for weaknesses such as lack of testability and overly complex \n          design, answering questions such as: Why is it untestable, and how can \n          this be changed? Is this much complexity necessary? What's wrong with \n          its information flow and presentation?  Chapter II: Laying the Trap The beast is captured and immobilized…\n          Through role playing in a simple release plan, participants will seek \n          to establish control of the project. This will include stabilizing the \n          system with an automated build and unit tests, bolstering communication \n          between teams through the planning game, and introducing usability tests \n          into the user acceptance process. Chapter III: Taming the Beast The beast is taught not to bite the hand that feeds it…\n          Using control established in stabilization phase, participants will \n          begin to add value to the application, making it more usable and crushing \n          bugs mercilessly underfoot. This will be accomplished by means of acceptance \n          tests, code refactoring, and examination of the information flow and \n          visual presentation of the application. Chapter IV: Domesticating the Beast The beast is compelled to return its stolen value…\n          Participants will discuss how to implement new functionality while minimizing \n          risk, expand XP's influence by introducing previously subdued practices, \n          and introduce usability and GUI enhancements into the system, while \n          discussing how these practices can be cleanly integrated into XP and \n          increase project velocity. Epilogue And they lived happily ever after?\n          Participants will engage in a process reflection to review intricacies \n          and implications of the lessons learned.\n      About the Presenters Kuryan Thomas is a Technical Director at C.C. Pace Systems in Fairfax, \n        Virginia.

117	SCRUM AND AGILE 101	Summary\nAgile processes are different. They not only increase productivity, they bring focus and pleasure back to systems development. This tutorial explains the underlying theory and practices of all agile processes, and then explains how they are implemented in Scrum. A case study is presented. An exercise is then conducted to give the tutorial attendees a feel for the flow, practices, and rules of Scrum. Tutorial attendees are organized into teams that collaborate with the customer to formulate an iteration, self-organize to identify the work in the iteration, report on progress and impediments during the iteration, and present the results of the iteration to the users. \nIf you are attending this tutorial and want to see Scrum applied to a product or system development at your organization, contact Ken Schwaber (ken.schwaber@verizon.net) prior to July 15. The most appropriate project will be selected and used in the tutorial.\n\nDuration: 3 hr (half day) \n\nAims\nTo provide the audience with a description of Scrum, why it works, and how it works. To describe the underlying basis and theory of agile processes, including emergence, self-organization, collaboration, iterations, and incremental delivery. To provide a first hand experience being in a Scrum team highlighting the different feel between agile and traditional processes.\n\n\nAudience\nIndividuals that want to use Scrum's high-productivity, agile methods for a project, and individuals that want to understand Scrum and agile practices. \n\nOutline\nPart 1: Scrum theory and practices discussion (75 min)\nLecture style delivery\nSpeaker introduction \nDefined control vs empirical control \nIncremental functionality, emergence, and self-organization \nScrum process overview \nProduct/ system vision \nWhat is the product backlog and who is the product owner? \nWhat is a Scrum team? \nHow do you plan a Sprint (iteration)? \nHow does a team commit to a Sprint goal? \nWhat is Sprint backlog? \nWhat are daily Scrums? \nHow does a team balance its committments within a fixed Sprint in light of emerging requirements, technology, and team dynamics? \nWhat does it mean to abnormally termate a Sprint? \nWhat happens at the end of Sprint review? \nPart 2: Case Study Overview (15 min)\nPresentation of case study\nVision \nTechnology \nRequirements \nRisks \nAssumptions \nPart 3: Translation of Case Study to First Sprint (90 min)\nFacilitated workshop\nSynthesize vision into product goal \nDevelop product requirements list \nSelect first Sprint product backlog and define Sprint goal \nBreak into Scrum teams \nEach team defines its Sprint backlog - self-organization \nEach team has a daily Scrum to report progress \n \n\nPresenter Resume\nKen Schwaber is one of the developers of the Scrum agile process and has extensively used agile processes over the last seven years.

118	HOW TO BE A COACH	Tutorial Summary\nIt's difficult to start a new process, but a coach can make this easier. A coach is part\ndeveloper and part manager. Coaches help a team stay on process and they help the team\nlearn. A coach brings in some outside perspective to help a team see themselves more\nclearly.\nWe'll use a combination of lectures, games, and exercises to explore and practice skills\nthat coaches (and team members!) can use.\n\nDuration: Half-day\n\nAims\nGive students:\nA deeper look at the coach's role\nTools to help communicate better\nPractice with charts, retrospectives, and other feedback tools\nPractice diagnosing team problems\n\n\nAudience\nCoaches, budding coaches, and developers on XP or agile teams.\nContent OutlineThe coach's role\nTeam formation \nBig Visible Charts \nRetrospectives \nWorking yourself out of a job\nPresenter Resumes\nWilliam C.

Given the data on a chart, what does it\ntell you about the team, its product, and process? We'll provide charts, and ask small\ngroups to interpret them.\nRetrospective: \nXP teams value feedback because it gives them an opportunity to learn. By holding end-\nof-iteration retrospectives, a team can learn from recent mistakes and tune its process.\nWe'll help small groups hold quick retrospectives.	Main conference	Tutorial	2002
119	PAIR PROGRAMMING: EXPERIENCE THE DIFFERENCE	Tutorial Summary\nAbstract: Pair programming is emerging as an important technique for developing higher quality\ncode, faster. With pair programming, two software developers work on one computer,\ncollaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or test. This tutorial examines pair\nprogramming research results and anecdotal experiences of programmers who have\ntransitioned to pair programming. It will discuss what works and what doesn’t and will also\nexplain techniques for fostering support in making a transition to pair programming – support\nfrom management and support from peers. Hands-on activities will be used to demonstrate pair\nprogramming benefits.\nObjective: Participants will experience the difference between working alone and working in\npairs. They will understand the research results that show pair programming works, learn how\nto pair program, what not to do when pairing, and how to transition to pair programming.\nLevel:: Beginner\nAttendee Background: This tutorial is targeted toward software developers and technical\nsoftware development managers who are interested in transitioning to pair programming.\nPresentation Formal: About half of the tutorial time will be presentation based. The remaining\ntime will be spent on activities and discussion.\n\nPresenter Resumes:\nDr. Laurie Williams is an assistant professor at North Carolina State University. In 2000, she\ncompleted her dissertation which demonstrated statistically that pair programmers were able to\nproduce higher quality produces in essentially half the time when compared to individual\nprogrammers. Prior to her recent academic career, Laurie worked at IBM for nine years.\nDr. Robert Kessler is a full professor at the University of Utah. He has a BS, MS and PhD in\nComputer Science from the University of Utah. He has founded several companies and is on\nthe board of several others.\nDr. Williams and Dr. Robert Kessler are currently collaborating on a book entitled Pair\nProgramming Illuminated, to be published by Addison-Wesley in July 2002.\nRepeat: Yes\n\nContent Outline for Half-Day Tutorial (3 Contact Hours):\nI.

Summary and Conclusion (10 min.)\nTutorial Resume:\nThis tutorial was given at OOPSLA in October 2001 and at the NASA Software Engineering\nWorkshop in November 2001.\n\nTutorial Notes:\nTutorial participants are divided into teams of four. The three exercises proceed as follows:\nActivity One:\n1. A problem statement for a design is provided.\n2. Each participant individually produces a working design.\n3. Teams convene and review each of the designs, enumerating the features that are\ncommon among the designs and those that are unique.\n4. All tutorial participants discuss:\na. Observation – When engineers work individually on a design, there will be some\nsimilarities among the designs. However, each engineer will typically incorporate\na larger number of unique features.\nb. What conclusions can be drawn from this experience?\nActivity Two:\n1. A problem statement for the design of a device is provided.\n2. Each participant is given a role in the design of one module of the device. Each\nparticipant must complete his or her assignment without collaborating with the team.\n3. Each participant must then draw his or her current view of the team’s device without\ncollaborating with the team.\n4. Participants integrate their designs into one team device.\n5. All tutorial participants discuss:\n   a. How far away their initial knowledge of the entire device was from the integrated\nteam drawing (step 3 vs. step 4).\n   b. How the pieces they designed individually did not really fit together into a\nmeaningful device.\nActivity Three:\n1. A problem statement for the design of a device that is enhanced from the previous\ndevice is provided.\n2. Each participant is given a role in the design of the device. This participant is given\nultimate authority over this aspect of the system in the upcoming collaboration.\n3. Each participant is assigned a partner to work with. Together the pair work on the two\nthings they were assigned.\n4. Partners rotate so that each person is paired with a team member they did not work with\nyet. Together the pair work on the two things they were assigned.\n5. Partners rotate again so that each person is paired with the last team member they did\nnot work with yet. Together the pair work on the two things they were assigned.\n6. Each participant must then draw his or her current view of the team’s device without\ncollaborating with the team.\n7. Participants integrate their designs into one team device.\n8. All tutorial participants discuss:\n   a. How much they now knew about the overall team design before integration.\n   b. How the pieces they designed in pairs generally fit together into a meaningful\ntransportation device.\nNote: The same amount of time is allotted for each activity. With each successive activity,\nmore time is spent on initial designing and less integration time is necessary.	Main conference	Tutorial	2002
120	HOW TO START AN XP PROJECT: THE INITIAL PHASE	Abstract\nWithin Extreme Programming, the initial phase of a project is the exploration phase. This phase should establish\na common view of the system to be built and provide the base for what XP calls “productionizing” – the full-fledged\nXP development iterations. Therefore this phase is of crucial importance to the whole project. While\nthere is a lot of documented experience with the XP process itself, little has been said about the initial phase.\nThis tutorial presents a number of best practices and experiences to structure and master the exploration phase.\nThey will guide the team from the kick-off meeting to the first implementation of the system skeleton. The\ntechniques presented have been adapted to XP from experience gained in twelve years of consulting in\nprofessional object-oriented development projects. They have been successfully applied in numerous XP\nprojects, ranging from high-pressure short-term to large-scale long-term, from finance to the health domain, and\nfrom greenfield development to legacy system replacement.\n\nTutorial Objective\nAfter the tutorial the participants will have a clearer idea of which concepts are helpful and which pitfalls should\nbe avoided in starting an XP project. They will be equipped with a number of practice-proven techniques for\ngaining first insights into the problem domain and finding a system metaphor. They will have learned to use\nspike solutions and prototypes effectively. Finally, they will have a better idea when to end the exploration phase\nand to move on to the well-described XP development iterations.\n\nLevel: Intermediate\n\nAttendee Background\nThe tutorial is targeted at (potential) XP project managers and experienced developers interested in the extreme\nprogramming process. It is assumed that the audience has some familiarity with the basic concepts of extreme\nprogramming or similar agile processes. The typical attendee is thinking about starting an XP project or has\nalready faced the challenges of the exploration phase.\n\n\nPresentation Format: Lecture with slides, discussion\n\nDuration: Half Day\n\nSupporting Material: Handouts containing the slides\n\nPresenters\nHolger Breitling is a research assistant at the University of Hamburg and a professional software architect and\nconsultant at APCON Workplace Solutions. He is a senior architect of the JWAM framework, which is\ndeveloped applying most of the XP techniques. He has several years’ experience with extreme programming\ntechniques working on several projects and is currently acting as a project coach and trainer in this domain.\nbreitling@jwam.org\nMartin Lippert is a research assistant at the University of Hamburg and a professional software architect and\nconsultant at APCON Workplace Solutions.

This experience in building teams from scratch, teaching them the practices of XP and the skills of test-first coding, OOD and Refactoring within an XP process has provided a wealth of experience that we would like to share with the rest of the software community.\nWe can provide excellent references on these projects upon request.\nEducation\nB.S.

122	TEST DRIVE FOR TESTERS: WHAT, WHEN, AND HOW TESTERS DO FOR XP TEAMS	Summary\nThis tutorial shows testers, or anyone wearing the tester hat on an XP team, how testers contribute to the project, including what testers should do, when they should do it, and how they should do it.   You’ll do exercises that show you how to either work on an XP team as a tester yourself, or work productively with a tester on your team.\n\nAudience\nXP newbies and veterans, testers, programmers, coaches, customers, analysts and managers.  Anyone who might be expected to help with some aspect of acceptance testing on an XP team, and anyone who wants to help their XP team maintain a focus on quality.\n\nDuration: Half-day\n\nDescription\nWe’ll take a trip through an iteration of an XP project step by step and show what goals to reach for, which activities to engage in, and some helpful techniques for testers to use.  The exercises are built around an XP project to develop a simple web-based tracking application.  \n\nTutorial Outline\nWhat testers do during release planning and story writing:\nHow to identify hidden, questionable and incorrect assumptions\nHow to define acceptance tests to make assumptions explicit\nHow to accurately estimate time for acceptance test tasks\nHow to enable accurate story estimates\nHow to ask questions to identify potential problems \nWhat testers do during iteration planning\nHow to help team think of all tasks needed to complete a story, including those relating to infrastructure, packaging, environment, functional and acceptance testing\nHow to promote understanding between the customers and the development team\nHow to break out and accurately estimate tasks related to acceptance testing\nWhat testers do during the actual iteration\nHow your team can define detailed, but not too detailed, and effective acceptance tests, accounting for unusual and external events as appropriate\nHow to document tests so they are easily understood and changed by the customer\nHow to design and code effective and maintainable automated tests \n\n\nPresenter's Resume\n\nLisa Crispin has worked as a tester on Extreme Programming teams for a one and a half years.

123	SCALING AGILE PROCESSES: AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN LARGE PROJECTS	Abstract\nOne saying is that, if you have a hundred people on a\ndevelopment team, get rid of at least eighty of them and\nkeep the top twenty (or less). As a result the chances for\nproject success will raise significantly. But maybe you\ndon’t have even twenty top ones and/or the company just\nhave these hundred people sitting around.\nIt seems like the only places where large projects with huge\nteams seem to really work are projects where everything is\nformalized, the requirements are fixed and, most\nimportantly, they don't change over time. A detailed plan\ncan be set up and every successive action will stupidly\nfollow the plan. Example are defense projects or projects\nwith a similar structure, such as in airlines or nuclear power\nplants.\nWe as software-engineers tend to question software\nengineering in the large not only because most of the agile\nprocesses claim to work only for small teams, also because\nmost of the failed projects are really large ones. (Well,\nmaybe nobody talks about failed small projects.) However,\nthere are more than enough projects that are large in some\nsense. So, the question arises, how to use aspects of agile\nsoftware development in large projects.\nWe don’t want to focus on every aspect of agile processes,\nbut on those who we encountered to be mainly different in\nlarge projects. The differences might be that some things\nhave to be implemented differently, because at a specific\nsize of the project things don’t work out the normal way\nanymore. Other differences are based on problems, which\npop up especially in large teams, or rather which won’t be\nproblems at all in small teams.\nThis tutorial is based on our experience coordinating – so\nfar successfully – a large (currently 160 people) project.\nAlthough we are still in the process of learning we would\nlike to share our experiences about how agile processes can\nserve large projects. And besides – chances are high, that at\nthe time XP Agile Universe 2002 is held, we have made\neven more valuable experiences.\n\nDuration, aims and audience\n\nDuration: Half-day tutorial\n\nAims:\n- Ideas on how to overcome the obstacles of agile\nsoftware development in the large\n- Know what the biggest problems of agile software\ndevelopment in the large are\n- Know how agile software development in the\nlarge could possibly work\nAudience\n- Those who tried to use agile methodologies in\nlarge projects and failed.\n- Those who tried to use agile methodologies in\nlarge projects and succeeded.\n- Those who didn’t try agile methodologies in large\nprojects but would like to do so.\n- Proponents of the linear (waterfall-) model who\nthink agile processes suck anyway\n- Proponents of agile processes who think an agile\nprocess would never work in the large\nProcess\n\nWe want to share our experiences as well as hear from the\naudience’s experience and questions. Probably we will use\ninteractive elements to work out patterns of agile\nprocessing in the large.\n\n\nContent outline\nLarge Projects and their environment\nLarge companies often run large projects. The organization\nof the companies forces the project to be run in a specific\nway. Often problems arise because of that. Some of the\norganizational departments have been introduced for non-agile\nprojects, which means they are for example not\nservice oriented, or human centered. They were invented\nfor controlling a project and supporting the organizational\nhierarchy.Theywerenot invented for supporting the needs\nof the different projects, so they don’t regard the projects as\ntheir customers.\nThis has different effects – often a project tries to ignore\nthose departments as good as possible. If this is not\npossible at all the project and the organizational\ndepartments fight against another, which costs of course a\nlot of time, energy and therefore money.\nThe only way out is to ask those other departments to come\non board of the project. – If you can’t fight your enemy you\nbetter work with them. – But beware; that it will take a\nwhile till the different teams will really work together.\nTypical organizational departments that don’t consider\nthemselves as a service to a project are: Project Planning\nand Controlling, Quality Assurance, Revision and the like.\nThe main difference with agile projects is here, that those\ndepartments are involved in the process from the very first\ntime.\nGetting Started\nWhat’s the best way to start an agile project with a large\nteam and what to start with?\nNot every change benefits from being introduced smoothly.\nSometimes it’s even better to change something so\nradically (shock-effect) that the real change you want to\nmake doesn’t seem so strange anymore compared to the\nexaggerated change.\nEspecially for large project continuous feedback is\nessential. For example cycles for iterations and releases\nhave to be much shorter than with smaller teams. The\nproblem is: If this tanker runs in the wrong direction, it is\nalmost impossible to change the course after a while.\nSo according to our experience the most important thing is\nto focus on all kinds of quick feedback: Organization,\nEnvironment, Running Software, Happiness of members of\nthe team, etc. This doesn’t sound too different from any\nother agile project, but establishing short feedback cycles is\nmuch more difficult that with small teams. But once this is\nestablished all other changes will follow more naturally\nCommunication\nInner team- and communication among teams have to be\nestablished.\nDifferent communication channels have to be ensured. It\nseems that as soon as one communication channel is\nestablished, it doesn’t work anymore. The main reason is\nthat a working communication channel is often overused\nwhich results in ignoring the channels. This means\nchannels have to be changed often over time.\nEvery person obtains information differently, using\ndifferent sensory modalities. Some people, the visuals,\nlearn most effective by watching; the auditories, by\nlistening and the kinesthetics, through action. Therefore,\nprovide different approaches to communicate. Accept\ndifferent communication media by addressing various\nsensory modalities.\nCustomer involvement\nThere hardly exists a single customer. Most often if the\nproject is really large, the amount of customers is in\nrelation to the size of the project.\nOften there are several customers, who are either invisible,\nlike for standard software, or it is a community of\ncustomers who have a similar – but not the same – interest\nin the project. Even worse the community of customers, is\noften competitive among themselves. This means it is hard\nto get them on-site, because there is no accepted\nrepresentative of the group and to speak with one voice. Of\ncourse the project can’t solve their competition problems,\nbut it can ask for regular feedback, which could of course\nsometimes be contradictory.\nThe best is to establish a substitute for the customer, which\nare domain experts and ideally have a history at the real\ncustomer-site.\n\nDifficulties in Planning\nEspecially for large projects it’s unusual to plan a projects\ntowards results. Typically the plan focuses on milestones,\nwhich do not reflect the highest priorities, biggest business\nvalue and the like. It’s often hard if not impossible to\nreplace such planning with elements such as planning\ngames or time boxes. However, it might be possible to\nintegrate both forms of planning.\n\nIntegration\nMost agile Processes require continuous integration with\ndaily (nightly) builds. This is often difficult with large\nteams because of several reasons.\n\nAbout the Author\nJutta Eckstein is an independent consultant and trainer from Munich,\nGermany. Her experience in agile processes is based on\nover ten years experience in developing object-oriented\napplications.

124	APPLYING XP TOOLS TO J2EE FOR THE EXTREME PROGRAMMING UNIVERSE	Abstract Summary\nApplying XP Tools to J2EE for Extreme Programming is a half day technical tutorial that focuses\non using Open Source Software tools to apply XP to Enterprise Java development, specifically for\ntesting web components. This session will mainly encompass automating the build & integration\nprocess and automating the testing process.\nEssentially this tutorial is a cookbook on how to implement XP methodology in an Enterprise Java\nshop. XP is the methodology, i.e., the philosophy. Ant, JUnit, etc., that helps developers realize\nthe XP philosophy in a J2EE environment.\nXP is comprised of much more than testing, integration & build tools, but testing and integration\ntools are one way that XP materializes in the development process. This tutorial covers the day-to-\nday application of XP tools - not the full XP process and methodology. Specifically, this\nsession will cover testing web components with JUnit, Cactus, JUnitPerf, HttpUnit, Ant, and\nJMeter.\nAims and Intended Audience\nMany books and papers on XP are focused on theory and methodology. Fewer publications,\nhowever, focus on practical application in a Java Enterprise Environment. XP is extremely\npopular! However, many development shops fail in instantiating the abstract concepts of XP in\ntheir Java development process. This tutorial is geared to address the gap between XP theory\nand real world application for automated testing and continuous integration in a J2EE\ndevelopment shop.\nThis educational session is geared for developers using J2EE and XP. This includes developers\nwho want ways to perform some level of testing and automated builds, as well as developers\nthat use testing as a central role in their development due to the XP.\nApplying XP Tools to J2EE for Extreme Programming Universe has been designed for designed\nfor an audience experienced in Java, as well as XP programmers who want to ease the\ndevelopment of Java web applications. These developers would be enterprise Web application\nspecialists with a grasp of Enterprise Java (J2EE) technologies: EJB, JDBC, JSP and Servlets.\nHowever, they would not have to be J2EE experts.\nAbout the Presenter\nRick Hightower, CTO of Triveratech, has over a decade of experience as a software\ndeveloper. In the past, he has helped development teams adopt new processes like Extreme\nProgramming, and technology adoption like J2EE.\nRick's publications include Java Tools for eXtreme Programming, which covers deploying and\ntesting J2EE projects (published by John Wiley, 2002); contributions to Java Distributed\nObjects (published by Sams); and several articles in Java Developer's Journal. Rick also\nwrote a three part tutorial series on EJB CMP/CMR for IBM developerWorks (published in\nMarch 2002).\nCurrently, Rick is involved in course development, mentoring, consulting and training on\nJava, J2EE, Web Services and XP projects. In his spare time, he does J2EE development.\nRcik’s detailed resume is attached.\nRick can be reached at 520-290-6855 or at RHightower@triveratech.com.\nOutline\nEach major concept will have supporting sample code.

126	REFACTORING: IMPROVING THE DESIGN OF EXISTING CODE	Summary\nAlmost every expert in Object-Oriented Development stresses the importance of iterative development. As you proceed with the iterative development, you need to add function to the existing code base. If you are really lucky that code base is structured just right to support the new function while still preserving its design integrity. Of course most of the time we are not lucky, the code does not quite fit what we want to do. You could just add the function on top of the code base. But soon this leads to applying patch upon patch making your system more complex than it needs to be. This complexity leads to bugs, and cripples your productivity. \nRefactoring is all about how you can avoid these problems by modifying your code in a controlled manner. Done well you can make far-reaching changes to an existing system quickly, and without introducing new bugs. You can even take a procedural body of code and refactor it into an effective object-oriented design. With refactoring as part of your development process you can keep your design clean, make it hard for bugs to breed and keeping your productivity high. \nIn this tutorial we'll show you an example of how a lump of poorly designed code can be put into good shape. In the process we'll see how refactoring works, demonstrate a handful of example refactorings, and discuss the key things you need to do to succeed.\n\nDuration: Half Day\n\nLevel: Intermediate\n\nPresenter's Resume\nMartin Fowler is the Chief Scientist for ThoughtWorks, Inc., a leading custom e-business application and platform development firm. For a decade he was an independent consultant pioneering the use of objects in developing business information systems. He’s worked with technologies including Smalltalk, C++, object and relational databases, and EJB with domains including leasing, payroll, derivatives trading and healthcare. He is particularly known for his work in patterns, the UML, lightweight methodologies, and refactoring. He has written four books: Analysis Patterns, Refactoring, the award winning UML Distilled, and Planning Extreme Programming. \nMartin has been giving this tutorial in various forms since around 1997. It has been presented at a wide range of commercial and academic conferences including OOPSLA (where it was one of the top 5 tutorials in 1999), Software Development,  and JavaOne.\nThe tutorial is based on the early chapters of Martin’s book “Refactoring: improving the design of exisiting code”.

127	THE AGILE DATABASE	Summary\nDoes your development team’s database strategy suck? Does your team even have a database strategy, or is this vital portion of your enterprise application - the repository of the data upon which your entire application rests - in the hands of some guy who sits on another floor or two buildings down the street? Is he even a member of your team?\nThe tutorial’s presenters do not have their sights trained on your database administrator, but they do intend to lay waste to the inefficiency and backward thinking inherent in the database-related practices of most development teams.\nThe tutorial will present a proven plan for adding agility to the database (starting with making the DBA a true member of the team). Participants will be shown how the application database can be structured to provide each team member with control of their own data space (similar to individual application instances). The presenters will explain, in detail, how processes and tools can be used to make the database more manageable and open to refactoring. Finally, the presenters will address the issue of applications that are already in production, and detail how the above topics still can apply to production environments.\n\nObjective\nAttendees will receive both (1) a thorough introduction to the concepts behind an agile database strategy, and (2) implementation-specific details that will allow them to introduce these concepts onto a development team.\n \nAttendee Background\nDevelopers, DBAs and project managers are encouraged to attend. Experience on a development team of eight or people is strongly recommended. Experience with an agile development methodology is recommended, but not required. A general understanding of relational databases and/or SQL is, similarly, recommended but not required.\n \nExperience Level: Intermediate\n \nPresentation Format: Lecture with slides\n\nDuration: Half Day\n\nOutline\n\nThe Development DBA\nManaging the Database: What Makes It So Complicated?\nThe Database Instance\nThe File System Metaphor\nThe Strategy\nThe Bifurcated Database\nThe Lineage of Instances\nThe Master Instance\nThe Update Log\nThe Update List\nImplementation\nThe Rules\nWho Gets to Play DBA\nTools and Automation\nTips and Tricks\nKnown Pitfalls\nLimitations\nAgile Database Development in a Production Environment\nPresenters\nPramod Sadalage, ThoughtWorks, Inc.\npramod@thoughtworks.com\n(312) 373-8555\nPramod Sadalage works as a Data Architect and Lead DBA at ThoughtWorks, Inc, a leading custom e-business application and platform development firm.

128	CHANGE WIZARDRY: TOOLS FOR GEEKS	Duration: Half-Day (3 hours)\nAudience: Agile/XP folks who are trying to make change happen\nAbstract:\nHave you noticed that it can be difficult to get your colleagues and/or your\norganization to adopt agile methodologies? "What's wrong with our current process?"\n"We don't have time for change." "I’ll never pair-program." "It's not in the budget."\n"We've never done that before."\nUnderstanding the organizational dynamics of change is critical to influencing the\nchangeover from traditional software development to XP or other agile\nmethodologies. This tutorial will introduce you to four change tools, which the\npresenters have found helped people and organizations actually effect a change.\nIn this tutorial you’ll apprentice as a change wizard, learning about:\n· Change Readiness Assessments\nConjuring up the right assessment tool will help you determine answers to\ncritical questions like: "Is there a chance for change?" “Do pockets of\nreadiness exist in my organization?” "What would need to be different around\nhere for change to occur?" Will the path to change in my organization be a\nmulti-step process or one transformational leap?"\n· Project Retrospectives\nCast the spell of learning. Change cannot happen without learning and\nretrospectives help organizations learn. The examination of past performance\ndata, which happens during a retrospective, yields a climate that fosters\nreadiness for change.\n· Paradoxes\nAmaze and astound your colleagues with paradox voodoo. Agile\nMethodologies are filled with paradoxes, contradictory conditions that must be\nresolved for effective and harmonious development. Once you tap in to the\npower of personal and team paradoxes you are better equipped to understand\nand work with resistance to change.\n· Chartering\nLearn a little piece of magic called a Charter and you'll know how to make a\ncommitment to change actually stick. A charter is a reference point or shared\nagreement between team players that provides direction during the course of\na project.\nJoin us and learn to do your own change magic.\nOutline:\n\nIntroductions\n Presenters\n Topic Overview\n Participants \n Understanding Change Dynamics – The Trances of the Status Quo\n Change Models\n Change Formula\n Practice experiencing and influencing change – interactive activities\n How does this relate to software development?\n Change Readiness Assessments – Divining the Source\n Examples and Anecdotes\n Interpreting the Assessment – experiential\n Project Retrospectives – The Spell of Learning\n End of Project Reviews and Norm Kerth\n The benefit of a retrospectives\n A mini-retrospective experience\n Paradox Voodoo\n Introducing paradoxes\n Finding where they live – interactive\n How to break the enchantment\n  Chartering – Change Wizardry That Sticks \n Chartering what and why\n Develop a charter – simulation\n What works?\n Wrap-Up\n Review - Earn your official apprentice wizard’s wand\n Resources for wizards\n Closing\n Presenters:\nJoshua Kerievsky is a software development coach and programmer. After\nprogramming on Wall Street for nearly 10 years, in 1995 he founded San Francisco\nBay Area-based Industrial Logic (http://industriallogic.com), a company that\nspecializes in Extreme Programming (XP). Since 1999, Joshua has been\nprogramming and coaching on small, large and distributed XP projects and teaching\nXP to people throughout the world. He regularly speaks about XP, has authored\nnumerous XP and patterns-based articles, simulations and games and is hard at\nwork on the forthcoming book, Refactoring to Patterns\n(http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/).\nDiana Larsen, a senior consultant with FutureWorks Consulting LLC, works with\nleaders of high tech companies, engineering teams, and development groups to\nstrengthen their ability to manage organizational changes (e.g., a migration to\nXP/Agile methods) and capture the learning from their development experiences for\nfuture projects. Based in Portland, OR, she has over twelve years experience with\nsupporting effective interaction, planning, and review, as well as managing projects.\nClients work with Diana because of her experience and expertise, but also because of\nher candor and her willingness to explore uncharted territory and innovative\nsolutions. She is a co-sponsor of the upcoming Project Retrospectives Facilitators'\nGathering and a speaker at conferences.\n\nSupporting Material:\nDiana and Joshua’s experience with Change Wizardry is the supporting material. As\nalways, we plan on conducting a highly interactive session. We will be providing\nhand-outs, which are still under development.	Main conference	Tutorial	2002
129	BEYOND THE CUSTOMER: AGILE BUSINESS PRACTICES FOR XP	AbstractThe role of the Customer/Product Owner in an Agile project is challenging. While much has been written about the Customer practices that address the interface with the Developers, a vital area of the product development process lies beyond that boundary in the business and product management domains. \nCustomers are faced with many tough questions: Are the stories supporting the real business goals? Do the release plans address the needs of all of my users? How can I determine the value and priority of the stories? How can I turn high-level business and product strategies into stories and release plans? How can I make sure that I'm using my Developers' time to produce the most business value? \nIn this tutorial we will explore some specific Agile solutions that we've successfully applied to the business side of real-world projects in concert with XP. Through a combination of light lecture, hands-on exercises, and group discussions, tutorial participants will learn new techniques and practices to introduce and apply to their projects. \nIn this tutorial, we'll cover: \nApplying Agile values and principles to create a relatively simple set of business practices that start with defining the corporate business objectives, and follow through to setting strategic product initiatives and developing specific product feature sets.Practices for identifying and resolving the often-competing interests of multiple stakeholders and user constituencies to create a single, cohesive product plan.Techniques for turning product initiatives and features sets into appropriate stories and release plans, using lightweight essential use cases and breadth-and-depth breakdowns.Valuing stories based on tangible, testable business value, such as revenue or customer satisfaction, and applying that valuation to the release planning and story prioritization practices.Creating a seamless, traceable link from high-level strategic business objectives to Developer's individual tasks.

130	XP RELEASE PLANNING AND USER STORIES	The "Circle of Life" in XP is the cycle: On-Site Customer, Planning\nGame, Small Releases, Acceptance Tests. This cycle, repeated for every\nrelease, and for every iteration, is the heartbeat of an XP project.\nIt provides the requirements that the programmers need in order to\nprogram, the development velocity and quality information that\nmanagement needs in order to steer the project, and the connection\nbetween wish and reality that the customer needs in order to choose\nwhat to do next and when to release. We don't call it the Circle of\nLife lightly.\n\nIn this half-day tutorial, you'll have the opportunity to experience\nthe same project three ways: with very low information, part of the\ninformation that XP can provide you, and with all the cost and value\ninformation that XP provides. You'll experience the highs and lows of\nworking on such a project, and learn hands-on why the XP planning\nprocess is so powerful within such a simple framework.\n\nThe session is based on Ann, Chet, and Ron's popular "small card"\ngame, where we simulate an important valuable project. This is the\nsame experience that we have offered at XP Immersions, Smalltalk\nSolutions, XP200n, and various on-site courses.\n\nWe use the release planning game to explore various project planning\nstrategies. The game is played in small groups of approximately four\nto eight players. Both programmers and customers may play, in any\ncombination.\n\nIn each cycle of the game, the players plan and "implement" a product.\nEach time through, they learn some new lessons enabling them to plan\nand implement better next time. Scoring is based upon each team?s\ntotal return on investment.\n\nBased on that experience, we'll then discuss how teams\nlike yours can get the cost and value estimates needed to run your\nproject the XP way. The session has been rated as valuable and\nenjoyable by all those who have taken part in it. If you haven't yet\nsuffered the joys and agonies of the "Small Card" game, this is your\nchance!

131	STEERING THE BIG SHIP: SUCCEEDING IN CHANGING AN ORGANIZATION'S PRACTICES	“Welcome, welcome!, we’re so glad you’re here.  We just have so many problems here at Mock Corporation.   Our software development has been a problem as long as we can remember.  We really thought we had it licked with the last process change we made.  It was kinda structured, but the plans looked great at the start of the project!   Now, some programmers are experimenting with this XP and Agile stuff and they really like it, but lots of people think it won’t work.”\nWelcome to Mock Corp.  In this tutorial, YOU are the coach, helping Mock Corp. over come the challenges of changing the practices they use to create software.   You’ll study Mock Corp’s people, teams, and the organization as a whole.  Common challenges in adopting new practices will be explored as Mock Corp. encounters them.  Resistance behaviors will be identified and tools to over come them will be presented.   Mock Corp. is a generalization of real people and companies that have undergone transition to XP.   Individuals from companies that have or are going through the transition will participate to tell their stories.\nChanging the way individuals work is a big challenge.  Changing the way teams work is an even bigger challenge.  Changing the way organizations work is harder still.  Moving to an Extreme or Agile way of developing software tests the ability of individuals, teams, and organizations to change.  The degree to which an XP or Agile transition is successful long term will primarily depend on this ability to change.  This tutorial will teach the participants about change at different levels in the organization and techniques to make change successful.   Special emphasis will be placed on the organization level change issues and the infrastructure required to make change stick.  \nDuration: half-day\nContent outline\n• Models of Organizational Change\n• Specific change issues caused by the transition to Extreme Programming or other\nAgile methods\n   o Programming Team Changes\n   o Customer Team Changes\n   o Management Changes\n• Mock Corp\n• Individual Change and Techniques (exercise)\n• Team Change and Techniques (exercise)\n• Organizational Change and Techniques (exercise)\n• Tales from the Trenches: Case Studies from Real World Transitions\nPresenter resume with contact information\nLowell Lindstrom has been involved in the teaching, coaching, and transitioning of\nnumerous XP projects in organizations of all sizes and varying domains. He is currently\nresponsible for the business development and strategy at Object Mentor and coaches\norganizations on customer skills and the organizational change aspects of Extreme\nProgramming. He has been professionally involved across of the spectrum of software\nbusiness for 17 years. After many years of developing and managing software projects,\nhe took on organizational change, marketing, and sales roles at a large technology\nproduct company. He has a BSCS from Northwestern University and a Masters in\nManagement from Northwestern's Kellogg GSM.\nLowell Lindstrom\nlindstrom@objectmentor.com\nPhone: 847-573-1565 x20\nMSN Chat: omlowell	Main conference	Tutorial	2002
132	AGILE ACCEPTANCE TESTING	The goal of this workshop is to discuss and develop practices for\nsupporting effective acceptance testing on agile projects. (Some refer\nto acceptance testing as system testing, functional testing, customer\ntesting or GUI testing).\nWhat skills are required for acceptance testing? How should acceptance\ntesters they interact with other members of the team? How can agile\nprojects support the automation of these tests?\nThis workshop will survey the participants experiences and\nunderstandings of what does and doesn't work. Participation is\nencouraged from testers, developers and anyone with an interest in\ntesting and experience with testing on agile projects.\nMore details are available at http://www.pettichord.com/agile_workshop.html	Main conference	Workshop	2002
133	DISTRIBUTED PAIR PROGRAMMING	Agile methodologies stress the need for close physical proximity of team\nmembers. However, circumstances may prevent a team from working in close\nphysical proximity. For example, a company or a project may have development\nteams physically distributed over multiple locations. As a result,\nincreasingly many companies are looking at adapting agile methodologies for\nuse in a distributed environment.\nThe aim of this workshop is to bring together practitioners who have\nexperiences with distributed pair programming.  In addition, the workshop\nwill be especially valuable to participants who are involved in development\nactivity that is geographically distributed and are interested in applying\ndistributed pair programming.  We further want to incorporate experiences\nand research in Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) environments.\nOverall, the workshop will discuss how to make this type of distributed work\nas effective as possible and will help guide future research.\nFor more information http://dxp-cs.cs.unc.edu/XPU-DPP-workshop/	Main conference	Workshop	2002
134	EMPIRICAL EVALUATION OF AGILE METHODS	Imagine the benefits of knowing that an XP project expends more effort\nunderstanding software requirements than does a team using a typical\ntraditional, or waterfall approach. Imagine the benefits of being able to\npredict that for this particular combination of customer, product, and\nproject team, agile modeling is going to benefit the team more than a strict\nXP implementation. The world we seek is one that de-mystifies the success of\nagile methods and supports everyday practitioners to apply the right method\nat the right time. We believe measurements are key to making these decisions\nand to making agile methods more accessible.\nPresently, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence and very little empirical\nand validated data of agile methods effectiveness. Much of the evidence is\nbased on the stories and preferences of those who practice it. The workshop\nparticipants are expected to share keen interests in finding practical\napproaches to measuring the effectiveness of agile software techniques in\nvarious project situations (both industrial and academic).\nMore	Main conference	Workshop	2002
135	LSO WORKSHOP	This is a full day workshop\nThe theme of the Fourth Workshop on Learning Software Organizations (LSO) is "Balancing Agile Processes and Long-Term Learning in Software Organizations". The LSO Workshop series focuses on technical, organizational, and social solutions to problems of learning from past experiences and codifying the resulting best practices so they can be systematically used in subsequent software development efforts \nThis workshop will explore the issues of managing knowledge in dynamic domains requiring significant levels of improvisation within each repetition of the process. The challenge is not one of capturing and finding complete solutions to problems, but the more difficult task of finding and integrating partial solutions that can serve as a baseline for continuous improvement, and hence, organizational learning. Techniques need to be explored that couple process and workflow management with knowledge management to capture and build an experiential body of knowledge for software development activities, while enhancing the ability of an organization to quickly adapt its processes to new technologies and market pressures.\nLearn More	Main conference	Workshop	2002
136	Setting the Agile Context	The use of agile software methods requires a proper context.  As with\nother methods, a poorly managed and disordered environment makes\ncreative technical work difficult and often impossible.  In this talk,\nWatts Humphrey discusses the environmental characteristics required for\ncomplex creative work, how the working situation is typically\nestablished, and what the software professional can do to influence the\ncontext of his or her work.  He then describes the experiences of\ndevelopment teams in establishing and directing the environment for\ntheir own work.  He also provides data on how this affected the quality\nif their products and the productivity of their projects.  In\nconclusion, Mr. Humphrey discusses the factors that determine the\nability of professionals to set the contexts for their own work and how\nthis relates to the use of agile methods.

137	XP FEST (Monday)	XP FEST\nOne of the core values of XP is feedback, which involves going beyond just talking about something to actually doing it as quickly as possible, because only then do you know if it makes any sense. So, instead of just coming to XP/Agile Universe and talking about XP, why not do some XP, too? It seems fitting to go beyond just talking about abstract concepts to actually implementing them in a simple format.\nIn the style of OOPSLA's AnalysisFest, DesignFest and CodeFest, with their waterfall view of software development, you can participate in XPFest at XP/Agile Universe.\nGoals:\nLearn XP by doing.\nBe exposed to different views of XP. \nTry out XP if you haven't tried it yet. \nCompare how different teams adapt XP. \nHave fun doing something you enjoy: programming using XP! \nMondayTuesday(1) Customer - someone who has a small problem they'd like solved.

140	SHARPENING THE AXE FOR TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT	Summary\nAbraham Lincoln is famously (mis-) quoted:\n"If you showed me a big tree and an axe and\ngave me eight hours, I’d spend the first 6 hours sharpening the axe.” Software shops all over the world are now\npracticing XP, and specifically Test Driven Development. The tutorial below sets out to accomplish\nthree goals: 1) Offer information on known axe-sharpening efforts in XP-Land. \n2) Provide a demonstration of a small set of hand-rolled tools for TDD\nin real-world projects. 3) Advocate the\nkind of deep laziness that gives making and refining tools its proper value in\nthe framework of XP.\n\nDuration and Target Audience\nThis is a half-day tutorial whose target is intermediate or\nadvanced programmers who feel they are not getting maximum value from the TDD\napproach. Anyone who is trying TDD\nis welcome. Anyone who has understood\nthe urgency of adopting TDD but who is still using crude and ineffectual\ntools should benefit. The presenters particularly welcome new\nadopters and those working with or leading them.\n\n\nOutline\nNote: The tutorial will be handled in true XP style. What follows is a\nrelease plan, and as the class develops, it will surely flex to meet the\nattendees' needs. The real point of the tutorial is to provide a focused topic\nand bring TDD adopters face to face with an experienced practitioner for our\nmutual entertainment and edification. The presentation includes working programs, sample code, and a variety\nof tips, tricks, and techniques.\nThere are Axes and Axes:  It’s Better Than Using A Plastic Knife\n\nThe xUnit Family\n What a Dull xUnit Does, and How\n   The Three Pieces of All xUnits\n   A One-Day xUnit for Language X\nWhat a Sharp xUnit Does, and How\nA Very Sharp xUnit\nIntegrated xUnit\nDeep Laziness:  Preparing And Refining A Good Axe\nIntroducing Tool Smells\n   Learning Not To Type\nCreating Inaccesible Engines\nMaking Your Tool Yours\nBuy, Borrow, or Build?\nxAT, xVersion, xGUI, xProcess:  Attacking The Rest Of The Forest\nWhat xUnit Doesn’t (and Shouldn’t?)

141	Review of Agile Approaches	In our Information Age, competitive advantage comes from speed and flexibility. With shortened product development cycles and rapidly changing business initiatives, the formula for success has been articulated by Tom DeMarco: “Agility: 1, everything else: 0.” Agile Software Development redefines how software will be delivered in our 21st century economy.\n\nThere has been a rapidly rising interest in these new approaches to software development such as Extreme Programming, Scrum, Adaptive Software Development, Feature-Driven Development, and Dynamic Systems Development Methodology. Furthermore, scores of organizations have developed their own “lighter” approach to building software.\nThis tutorial is based on the material in Jim Highsmith’s book, Agile Software Development Ecosystems. He is the developer of one of the Agile Methodologies (Adaptive Software Development), a coauthor of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, and founding member of the AgileAlliance. The workshop addresses key questions: What are Agile Methodologies? What problem domains to Agile Methodologies address? What are the common principles and practices of the various Agile Methodologies? What are the similarities and differences between the various Agile Methodologies?\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
142	Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices	For the first four decades of software development we did not had a good definition of our craft. If you asked a software developer what he did, he'd have to say something vague like "I write code." Sometimes developers created something good, but could't repeat the process. They could do good things sometimes but didn't know how they did it. Quality was more an accident than a design. In the last decade this has changed significantly.\n\nWe have identified enough principles, patterns, and practices to provide our craft with a solid definition. This definition gives us something we may not have had before -- pride in workmanship. For though we may have been able to take pride in some of our projects before, we weren't often able to take pride in the “way” those projects were build. Now, we can take pride in ”how” we build software, not just in the software we build.\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
143	From Agile Modeling To Agile Data	In this interactive tutorial we will discuss two agile methodologies --Agile Modeling (AM) and the Agile Data (AD) method.  AM is a chaordic, practices-based methodology which describes how to effectively model and document software based systems.  Modeling and documentation does not have to be dysfunctional!  The AD method encompasses philosophies and techniques which enable data professionals to become active and productive members of an agile software development team.  Modern software development is evolutionary (iterative and incremental) in nature, therefore data professionals need to adopt techniques such as database refactoring, evolutionary performance tuning, Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD), and Test-Driven Development (TDD).  We'll also discuss implementation issues -- mapping objects to RDBs, referential integrity, security access control, transaction control -- that include but go beyond the domain of data.  The AD method also addresses enterprise issues, enterprise architecture and enterprise/data administration, that are critical to your success.  Even enterprise groups can to take an agile approach to development.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
144	An Agile UP	The Unified Process (UP) is popularand with good reason, as it includes skillful practices such as iterative development, and early attention to risks.  However, many organizations are adopting it in an unskilled manner, superimposing “waterfall” or “heavyweight” values onto it that need not apply. Applied well, the UP encourages an agile approach, and so you will learn the essential useful UP practices, the keys to its successful introduction in an organization, and how to apply the UP in an adaptive and agile spirit. And, how to screw it up.  Further, many XP and Scrum practices are either part of the UP, or specializations of more general UP guidelines. What are these, and which may be adopted consistent with a UP project? Nevertheless, this tutorial motivates the need for more than just XP or Scrum on many projects. You will learn why a combination of primarily the UP with other agile process practices is an excellent approach.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
145	Inside Feature Driven Development	Feature Driven Development (FDD) is a proven-in-practice process for producing software applications. Rather than being "all new," Feature Driven Development is a blend of known best practices and techniques, with only those things that really matter abstracted out and described in its simple process descriptions. Only five processes of one to two pages each - and they tell you what to do. This tutorial teaches you the thinking and practices behind FDD and the five FDD processes in detail - explaining the how and the why for each of them.  You will learn how to apply the most relevant practices from Feature Driven Development and how to avoid common mistakes. You will learn why practices are included in FDD and why other practices are not. You will learn about the project as a system versus the software system being constructed. You will learn what a client-valued feature is and how to express a project as a categorized list of client-valued features. You will learn how the first three FDD processes form a project startup phase and how useful a risk reduction strategy that is for you and your clients, plus learn about important predictive metrics from the startup phase to help you size and cost the subsequent construction phase. You will learn how feature teams are dynamically formed, changing the traditional hierarchic project structures. You will learn about feature milestones and how they solve that worldwide problem word for developers - “finished.” Plus you will learn how the milestones are used for amazingly accurate tracking and reporting that is meaningful to clients and keeps your project team better focused  as everything is expressed in the language of the domain rather than the technologies in use. You will learn how in the construction phase, features are bundled into workpackages and collectively moved through the design and build processes. You will learn about scope or feature creep and how to manage it, plus where the accountability for estimating really lies.  The tutorial also teaches, for the first time publicly, FDD workflow which comprises the key “how to” lessons for the FDD construction phase processes  Design By Feature and Build By Feature.  Learn how there are multiple levels of delegation and self-organization happening within the FDD construction phase, but all within planned assembly.  You will learn how and why FDD can scale to very large projects and, finally, throughout the tutorial you will learn key lessons from over 20 years experience in the industry. Bring your questions, stories of what's worked and what hasn't. Interact with and learn from an experienced project manager and the developer of Feature Driven Development.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
146	XP/Agile Organizational Change - Tools for Successful Adoption	Yes, XP and other Agile methods are awesome, but what about your colleagues and managers who staunchly resist them? Have you retreated to practicing only a few XP/Agile practices because you haven’t been able to overcome organizational resistance? Do you feel you are not important enough in your organization to help make extreme changes? Helping organizations, teams and individuals adopt an XP/Agile process is a whole lot easier when you’ve learned the tools of organizational change. In this tutorial, you’ll learn from folks who’ve made extreme changes happen across entire organizations with the help of tools like: change readiness assessments, project charters, test-driven management, retrospectives and more. This tutorial is hands-on and chock full of real-world stories. Join us and learn to practice your own change magic.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
147	Understanding Users and User Tasks	Usability is increasingly recognized as important for the success of software and Web-based applications, but developers often lack the time and techniques needed for effective user interface design. Extreme programming and other agile methods have proved their ability to deliver quality software quickly, but have offered little in the areas of software usability and user interface design. This tutorial introduces core techniques of a proven approach that complements agile development methods. In agile usage-centered design, the focus is on quickly developing a clear understanding of users and user tasks through minimal models that provide maximum payoff. Using hands-on application to a simplified case study, the tutorial will show how ordinary index cards can efficiently model the roles users play in relation to a system and the tasks they need to perform within those roles. The use of card-based user and task models to inform and organize planning and design will be illustrated.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
148	Collaboration 4 Agile Projects	Human interactions are the way we get work done and are the way decisions are made. In Agile projects, we place interactions over documentation and collaboration over contracts. So, meetings for any decision points in an Agile project need to be lean, focused, and productive. Agile teams with outstanding collaboration skills hold the true key to making their projects work. This fast-paced tutorial demystifies the “art” of collaboration with common-sense skills and processes to use again and again in every Agile interaction. In this tutorial, participants will: understand the role of collaboration and consensus in Agile Projects, learn key techniques and processes to use in Agile collaborations and practice these collaboration techniques.\n\nThis tutorial is mapped to the International Association of Facilitators’ schema for effective meeting management. The instructors teach with a high-energy and highly interactive style, maximizing the learner’s experience through the application of sound adult learning techniques. Templates and agenda guides will be provided as “take-aways.”\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
149	The Lean Development Toolkit	The Lean Software Development tutorial, identifies seven fundamental “lean” principles, adapts them for the world of software development, and shows how they can serve as the foundation for agile development approaches that work. Along the way, you will discover 22 “thinking tools” that can help you customize the right agile practices for any environment.\n\nBetter, cheaper, faster software development. You can have all threeif you adopt the same “lean” principles that have already revolutionized manufacturing, logistics and product development.\nIterating towards excellence: software development as an exercise in discovery\n\nManaging uncertainty: “decide as late as possible” by building change into the system\n\nCompressing the value stream: rapid development, feedback, and improvement\n\nEmpowering teams and individuals without compromising coordination\n\nSoftware with integrity: promoting coherence, usability, fitness, maintainability, and adaptability\n\nHow to “see the whole”even when your developers are scattered across multiple locations and contractors\n\nSimply put, Lean Software Development helps you refocus development on value, flow, and peopleso you can achieve breakthrough quality, savings, speed, and business alignment.

150	Customer Testing with FIT: a Hands-On Introduction	This tutorial will introduce the Framework for Integrated Test (fit) and demonstrate its use in Test-Driven Development (TDD) as practiced in Extreme Programming and other agile development methods. Projects use fit-style tests as much to guide programming as to test the correctness of the result. Test-driven designs are more easily "refactored" making it the only programming method that expects programs to get "cleaner" over time.\n\nShort lectures will explain just enough of Extreme Programming to establish the context for test-driven design. These will be followed by live demonstrations and laboratory exercises. The labs will use simple Java, but the emphasis is on familiarity with the frameworks, tools and techniques, not programming. If you are unfamiliar with Java you will learn enough just by watching so as to be able to complete some of the exercises and received all of the benefits of the class.\nBring a laptop, or join someone who has, to do hands-on exercises. Bring a wireless networking card to participate in additional "online" activities. Install java at home to save time in class. Google "sun java download" to find a version for your computer.\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
151	Introduction to Scrum	This tutorial will create an experience of Scrum in a project setting, showing how to plan and manage products and projects using incremental, iterative development based in the agile processes. Specifically, this tutorial will provide:\n\nAn understanding of empirical processes, emergence, self-organization, and adaptation;\n\nA detailed understanding of Scrum principles, flow, roles, artifacts, and operation;\n\nA detailed case study of Scrum being used to solve a competitive problem for a large financial institution;\n\nA detailed description of the role and responsibilities of the product owner, ScrumMaster, and development team;\n\nA description of how to use Scrum to develop software for mission critical and life critical systems;\n\nAn approach to using Scrum for fixed price/fixed date contracts;\n\nAn understanding of how Scrum addresses CMM level 2 and 3 requirements;\n\nAn understanding of how to quickly implement agile software development so projects start producing product increments;\n\nAn understanding of implementation alternatives and their benefits for Scrum;\n\nAn understanding of how Scrum solves predictability and productivity issues for projects and products;\n\nAn understanding of the overlap between Scrum and Extreme Programming and how to use Scrum to wrap Extreme Programming to provide project and organizational scalability and control; and,\n\nAn understanding of Scrum as a methodology and toolset that can be used to Plan, Customize, and Manage any type of project.\n\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
152	Patterns for Agile Software Configuration Management	Software Configuration Management (SCM) is sometimes thought of as a heavy weight discipline that contributes to the rigidity, rather than agility, of the development team. This perception comes out of viewing circumstances where SCM practices were inappropriate to the project. In many cases, proper use of SCM practices can add a level of reproducibility and accountability to the development effort that can enable agility. The tutorial gives a brief overview of the basics of Software Configuration Management, and describes how to use SCM effectively in an Agile environment by describing key SCM Practices that are needed to have a stable, yet agile development environment. This includes practices relating to versioning, workspaces, testing, build, and branching. The tutorial is taught from the perspective of SCM as a part of the daily development cycle. We use a pattern language as a mechanism for describing how the practices fit together, but an understanding of patterns and pattern languages in not essential to understanding the material. Some background on the patterns is available at: www.scmpatterns.com.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
153	Project Retrospectives in Agile Development	The Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto state that, “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.” How can we do that? This tutorial will present techniques for facilitating project retrospectives that allow teams to discover what they’re doing well so that their successful practices can be repeated and what they’re not doing as well so that they can discuss how to improve. Retrospectives are not “finger pointing” sessions, but rather a fun and highly effective series of activities in which teams can reflect on the past in order to become more effective in the future. Participants will be introduced to the retrospective process, learn various techniques for leading retrospectives, hear the experiences of the tutorial leaders who have led retrospectives in various kinds of projects, and will get the opportunity to participate in a retrospective simulation.\n\nwww.lindarising.org\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
154	The Crystal Methods, or How to Make a Methodology Fit	Crystal is a family of highly tolerant, lightweight methodologies and a framework for tuning them to your specific situation. Here, methodology means nothing more (or less) than the conventions the team agrees to use. Level of detail and formality, documents and reviews, office seating and timing of parties can be part of those conventions. Projects vary in size, criticality and priorities, and so should your methodology. The strengths and weaknesses of the organization, the specific people, even the office layout affects how the team best works, and therefore should influence the methodology.\n\nA Crystal methodology aspires to be the least constrictive and yet effective methodology for any particular project team. This tutorial describes the principles and techniques for shaping a methodology to the project-team combination, introduces the colors in the Crystal family, compares different examples of the Crystal family to each other relative to the principles, and shows the differences between Crystal Clear and XP. Expect to learn the methodology tuning principles, and experience how easy and fruitful a methodology-tuning session can be.\n	Tutorials	Tutorial	2003
155	How to be a Coach	It’s difficult to start a new process, but a coach can make this easier. A coach is part developer and part manager: a coach can help a team stay on process and can help the team learn. A coach brings in some outside perspective to help a team see itself more clearly. We’ll use a combination of lectures, games, and exercises to explore and practice skills that coaches (and team members!) can use. The goal of this tutorial is to give participants: a deeper look at the coach’s role, tools to help communicate better, practice with charts, retrospectives, and other feedback tools and practice diagnosing team problems.

156	Testing Agile/Agile Testing: What Testers Do for Agile Teams, What Agile Practices Do for Testers	There are a plethora of agile processes being practiced: Extreme Programming, SCRUM, Crystal, FDD, DSDM, and others. It’s not always clear how a tester fits in to these new software development methods. Even if your organization isn’t using agile methods to develop software, you can benefit from using an agile approach to testing. For the tutorial we’ll use XP as an example, but the lessons learned apply to other agile processes. We’ll go through an iteration of an XP project step by step and show what goals to reach for, which activities to engage in, and some helpful techniques for testers to use. The exercises are built around an XP project to develop a simple web-based tracking application. We’ll examine the techniques we use and see how they could apply in a non-agile setting.

157	YP and Urban Simulation: Applying an Agile Programming Methodology in a Politically Tempestuous Domain	YP is an agile programming methodology that has evolved over the past 15 years. Many of its features are common to other agile methodologies; its novel features include using a highly visible, physical software status indicator (a real traffic light), and a well-defined nested set of development cycles. It is also an exceptionally open process, with the current status of the development process visible to the customers, as well as the code and documentation. We are using YP in developing the software for UrbanSim, a sophisticated simulation system for modeling urban land use, transportation, and environmental impacts over periods of 20 or more years under alternate possible scenarios. Our purpose in developing UrbanSim is to support public deliberation and debate on such issues as building new transit systems or freeways, or changing zoning or economic incentives, as well as on broader issues such as sustainable, livable cities, economic vitality, social equity, and environmental preservation. The domain of use is thus politically charged, with different stakeholders bringing strongly held values to the table. Our goal is to not favor particular stakeholder values in the simulation or its output, but rather to let different stakeholders evaluate the results in light of what is important to them. There are several implications of this for the development process. First, having credible, reliable code is important -- and further, both the code itself and the development process that produced it should be open and inspectable, not a black box. Second, to allow us to respond quickly to different stakeholder values and concerns, a flexible agile development process is required.\n\nBjorn plans to bring his foul weather gear to the conference and mount a 2 minute production at the beginning of the talk (of the opening scene quoted in the Introduction), using selected members of the agile community for the parts of Ship-Master, Boatswain, and assorted mariners.\n	Research	Research Paper	2003
158	XP Culture: Why the twelve practices both are and are not the most significant thing	XP emphasizes underlying values as well as the more visible twelve practices. We examine the relationship between practices and values from the perspective of a model of culture and from an ethnographic study of mature XP practice. We conclude that the twelve practices are both significant and not significant. They are significant in that they do, in the reality of professional practice, give rise to a culture which embodies underlying XP values. They are not significant since both models of culture and the detailed manner in which the practices give rise to a culture suggest that alternative practices may achieve the same ends.

159	PARFAIT: Towards a Framework-based Agile Reengineering Process	The paper presents a sketch of a framework-based agile reengineering process, named PARFAIT, whose objective is to provide the users with evolved versions of legacy systems, as soon as possible. The overall static structure of the Rational Unified Process (RUP), originally developed for forward systems engineering, has been here adapted for reengineering and is used for PARFAIT documentation. Frameworks are used in the process aiming at an agile approach to support the reengineering. Frameworks allow applications to be rapidly created, more than if they are built from scratch. Agile characteristics, such as incremental approach, cooperative approach with users and customers, straightforwardness, adaptability, etc. give PARFAIT the ability to support the rapid evolution of the legacy system to a new version, according to the users and customers needs. A summary of a case study and the results obtained in the reengineering are presented. This study refers to a concrete reengineering case of a real system for controlling entry and exit of electronic appliances in a repair shop.	Research	Research Paper	2003
160	Observations on Balancing Discipline and Agility	Agile development methodologies promise higher customer satisfaction, lower defect rates, faster development times and a solution to rapidly changing requirements. Disciplined (or plan-driven) approaches promise predictability, stability, and high assurance. However, both approaches have shortcomings that, if left unaddressed, can lead to project failure. The challenge is to balance the two approaches to take advantage of their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. We believe this can be accomplished using a risk-based approach for structuring projects to incorporate both agile and disciplined approaches in proportion to a project’s needs.\n\nThis paper presents six observations drawn from our efforts to develop such an approach. We follow those observations with some practical advice to organizations seeking to integrate agility and discipline in their development process. The material presented here is drawn from our book Balancing Agility and Discipline: A Guide to the Perplexed (Addison Wesley, 2003).\n	Research	Research Paper	2003
161	Throwing Down the Gauntlet: Finding a Place for Discount Usability Engineering in Agile Development	Many software development organizations are reporting great success with agile software development techniques. However, few techniques explicitly incorporate usability engineering. Further, some agile techniques may not address certain kinds of usability problems. While there are many usability engineering techniques, discount usability engineering should be of particular interest to the agile development community because the two disciplines share many of the same underlying principles. The challenge for the agile development community is to find ways to incorporate such discount usability engineering practices.	Research	Research Paper	2003
162	Test Driven Development and the Scientific Method	The scientific method serves as a good metaphor for several practices in Extreme Programming (XP). We explore the commonalities and differences and show that the scientific method, by analogy, can be used to better understand Test Driven Development (and vice versa).	Research	Research Paper	2003

The tactics are accompanied by personal recollections of related experiences. Tactics are presented in three primary sections: the difficulty of making change; getting attention; and making a case for change.  A brief section on the consequences of change follows.

164	Evolving Agile in the Enterprise: Implementing XP on a Grand Scale	How can XP or other agile methods be used in large corporate IT shops? One large company found out, making XP the official corporate software development methodology for all projects over an 18 month period and counting. This paper explores many facets of that experience, beginning with a summary of the eight key determinants of organizational change model. It then follows the organization in implementing XP, using the change model as a yardstick to assess the success of the hoped for change. The paper concludes with key learnings regarding how to implement an agile methodology within a large organization.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
165	Improving the Interface Between Business and Product Development Using Agile Practices and the Cycles of Control Framework	The paper describes how we created and adopted an agile product development process in a small software company based on the Cycles of Control framework by combining selected agile practices and principles from the Scrum and XP methodologies. Describing the development process using the framework helped in identifying the crucial control points between business and development and enabled defining practical and well-functioning connections between them. The control points enable visibility and flexible management of product development status and direction. Currently Business understands development status better, which has led to fewer interruptions between the control points, and thus improved working conditions for Development. Positive experiences are reported of newly adopted practices such as scrum meetings, pair programming, and unit testing. However, finding and adopting technical tools to facilitate the process proved to be challenging.\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
166	Retrofitting an Acceptance Test Framework for Clarity	An XP customer needs to write and check acceptance tests. However, the format for defining the tests needs to be clear. Many acceptance test approaches use arcane formats which do not promote clarity for the customer, due to a conflict of interest between the complexities of automation and the needs of the customer. We discuss the evolution of acceptance tests to improve their clarity for the customer.\n\nSat is an acceptance test system for testing socket-based servers with multiple clients. The first version used an XML file to define the tests in a test suite. Any errors detected were written to a text log. There were two problems with this first version. The XML format made it difficult to read and edit the tests. When an error was given, it was not easy to identify the place in the test where the problem occurred.\nSat was altered to make use of Fit, a testing framework that uses HTML tables for defining tests and reporting any errors. We found the new version considerably easier to use. The tabular form makes it much simpler to read and alter the tests. Any errors are reported in a copy of the tables, in the place where they occur. We have also found it convenient to include information about the tests in the HTML, providing a form of "literal testing".\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
167	It's More than Just Toys and Food: Leading Agile Development in an Enterprise-Class Start-Up	One of the myths of Agile Development is that self-organizing teams do not need direction. The agile development movement focuses primarily on programmers: programmers should do X, Y and Z, and everyone else should do whatever it takes to support the programmers. A fantastic start, since programmers are the people who actually build the organization’s product; however, few techniques are offered to the rest of the organization.\n\nThe admonishment to managers instructing them to only provide “toys and food” and buffer the team from external distractions implies that leaders in an agile environment should do less work, and be less involved with the team on a day-to-day basis, than in a more traditional environment. In fact a leader in an agile group must do more than he/she would in a more traditional environment and must be even more involved in the day-to-day activities of the team.\nThe Sabrix development discipline has strong and deeply involved management as one of its keys to success. Management best practices, when applied appropriately and discerningly, do not limit, but rather enhance, the productivity and job satisfaction of the individual members of the engineering teams. This paper discusses ways a manager can and should help the team be more productive, have a better understanding of their fit in the organization as a whole and develop team members by being active and involved with the team and the rest of the company.\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
168	Ready-to-Roll Boxcar Development - a Flexible, Quality-Weighted Process	In January of 1996, Intuit’s QuickBooks team was faced with an aging code-base using a custom Mac/Win GUI toolkit, a large and rapidly growing customer base, and a rapidly growing and product-inexperienced engineering team. To increase the product’s quality and feature predictability while retaining its ship date rigidity, we created “Ready-to-Roll” Boxcar Development.\n\nThe process enabled the defining of each new feature, enhancement, or engineering re-architecture as a set of boxcars on the product train. A “coupled” boxcar was rapidly brought to a supportable level of quality, or “decoupled” for re-evaluation and re-engineering. Frontloading the highest priority boxcars increased predictability of the product train's contents, while the process allowed for greater flexibility with respect to overall content.\n“Ready-to-Roll” Boxcar Development kept the product within 2-3 weeks of being supportable and shippable. The process focused on individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change. Better yet, it worked!\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
169	Iteration Advocate/Iteration Transition Meeting: Small Sampling of New Agile Techniques Used at a Major Telecommunications Firm	This experience report demonstrates a successful implementation of Agile at a major telecommunications firm. Critical aspects to mention about this particular software endeavor include a) this could be one of the largest implementations of Agile documented thus far (approximately 275 immediate and over 3,000 supportive contributors involved), b) the team practicing Agile did so under the constraints of a waterfall-gated (both milestone and financial) environment, c) a 'practice tapestry'' approach was used to 'weave' together elements of Agile that would work for this organization, and finally, d) new practices, not previously known to the Agile community were applied in addition to those well known thus far. Specifically, iteration advocate and iteration transition meeting are two examples of new concepts. This paper focuses on these new practices in an effort to share them with the Agile community. The weaving together of existing and new practices, enabled this major telecommunications firm to deliver a major software release to its large customer base.

We discuss why we selected the combination of extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum as the base for our software development process and which "ceremony" we had to add in order to satisfy the requirements of CMM L2 and ISO9001. Also our major challenges at the moment are described, and the way we try to solve them. Furthermore we want to share a number of issues and experiences.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
171	Making Agile Development Work in a Government Contracting Environment	Before any of the current “agile” development methods, Earned Value Management provided information for planning and controlling complex projects by measuring how much “value” was produced for a given cost in a period of time. One shortcoming of an agile development method is its inability to forecast the future cost and schedule of the project beyond the use of “yesterday’s weather” metrics. These agile methods assume the delivered value, “velocity” in the case of XP, is compared with the estimated value  this is a simple comparison between budget and actual cost resulting in a Cost Variance. No Schedule Variance process is directly available in XP. Earned Value Analysis provides a means of predicting future schedule and cost variances through three measurements  budgeted cost for work scheduled, actual cost for work performed, and budgeted cost for work performed (earned value). This paper describes the use of Earned Value in conjunction with Agile Development on a mission-critical, high-security, government project.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
172	Agile Development in the Old Economy	As part of the delivery an automated hub for a postal operator, the Solystic company has to build a complex and feature rich Information System that supports a highly automated process with multiple intricate sub-processes and exceptions.\n\nThe effort has several challenges:\nIt is business critical for the customer, and the output of the project will give the customer a leading position;\n\nIt is the first time Solystic is managing a complete system project, although its mother company Northrop Grumman had previous experience of this business;\n\nThe program is one of the first of the Solystic company in the international field;\n\nIt is a fixed price, fixed time contract with a short time frame.\n\nTo face all these challenges, the software development group in charge of the Information System has adopted a number of agile practices and techniques to manage the project. The major project settings are adapted from Alistair Cockburn's Crystal set of methodologies, SCRUM and Jim Coplien's work on organizational patterns.\nThis paper presents the findings and lessons learned by the team and its manager.\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003

The report addresses the steps we have taken not only to deploy the practices, but also to gain customer support for them. It addresses variations we have used to adapt to our customer’s environment, including our approach to involving customer personnel at remote locations. We also address challenges we still must face, including how best to manage a product-line with agile development techniques.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
174	Agile Development and Remote Teams: Learning to Love the Phone	I currently work on a project where we adopted an agile process that integrates elements of extreme programming and agile modeling. Our approach is unconventional however; instead of the team being co-located, I work remotely as the lead developer.\n\nThe risk of increased communication costs can be mitigated rather easily.\nHowever, trust is the most complicated element of team dynamics to establish and maintain. A virtual team must address this issue in order to succeed. Remote teams can work quite well. We have been delivering quality software in a timely manner, within the expectations of management for the last two years. We actually are more efficient and successful with a virtual team than when we were all co-located in the same room.\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
175	Unfixing the Fixed Scope Project	Although it seems to be common knowledge that it’s impossible to succeed in a project with fixed time, quality and scope, we often continue to try anyway.\n\nThis experience report discusses our successful failure at running fixed time and scope projects. I say successful failure because we actually failed to fix scope but arrived at an acceptable way to vary scope and deliver on time in an environment not normally amenable to variable scope. This paper discusses the methods used and makes recommendations on how you might unfix scope in your development environment.\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003
176	An Agile Request For Proposal (RFP) Process	The Request For Proposal (RFP) process can be agile and efficient. At a high level, the key to achieving this is to specify requirements just in time and containing just enough detail. This paper applies the following XP practices and concepts to the RFP process: acceptance tests, business value, iterative & incremental delivery, on-site customer, pair development, planning game, spike, story, velocity, and yesterday’s weather. In addition, the following concepts are combined with those from XP to achieve maximal benefit: user-goal use case, context diagram, level of detail, and decision tree.\n\nThe contributions of this paper to the agile community are two-fold: describing a practical application of XP concepts to a non-programming project; and making use case style requirements processes more agile.\n	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2003

178	Agile Contracts (W180)	Agile contracts: These two words together in one phrase just look odd - or at least they seem to be at odds with each other. Contracts have played a very important role in the business of software development; in fact, much of this work is in fact done 'under contract'. Organizations adopting agile methodologies are finding it hard to write contracts for software development without compromising the core values and practices. The Agile Contracts workshop is your chance to help the agile community identify ways contracts can be structured and worded to support agile software development.

179	Evaluating and Documenting Alternatives to Certification (W180)	Martin Fowler led a discussion on Paying For Better Value at the Agile Universe 2002 conference. It posed the question: “How do we make it accepted that able people who are expensive end up being better value than cheap, less able developers?”\n° What makes an expert Agile software developer? How do we prove that we are one? We believe the pattern of Expert Capability Maps answers these questions. In this workshop we will all share our perspectives and assess our own capabilities. If you are an expert you will leave with the proof of it. If not, you will leave with a map of your route to becoming an expert.\n° The steps to proving expert capability are 1) describe the attributes of an expert, and 2) get external validation we possess those attributes. Help us evaluate and document why certification and other common systems fall short in attempting this. We will also demonstrate that such experts provide economic value far beyond that of those with lesser capability or experience.\n° Before the conference please join our AgileAssessment list to contribute to creating an Expert Capability Map for Agile software development, using Behaviorally Anchored Self-Assessments. We will also be posting the evolving documents (does not require list membership).\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
180	Customer Collaboration: Challenges and successes in practice (G90)	An important principle in agile methodologies is to value customer collaboration over contract negotiation. In XP, for example, this principle is instantiated through the practice of having an end user on-site, someone who is available to answer questions, resolve disputes and set small-scale priorities on an ongoing basis. Other agile methods suggest alternative approaches. This form of customer collaboration is different from the traditional approach to requirements engineering where a substantial period of investigation and negotiation takes place to uncover the client's requirements.\n\nThe session will share, and then disseminate to a wider community, practitioners' experiences with, and insights into, customer collaboration within an agile environment.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
181	Enterprise Continuous Integration Limitations and Challenges (T90)	Continuous Integration as discussed in the Extreme Programming literature and elsewhere is largely focused on the development, integration and deployment of a single software product. Many IT shops however have additional problems to solve, problems that result from operating at an enterprise scale.\n\nThis session will determine issues and limitations in scaling Continuous Integration to the enterprise, and identify strategies for overcoming these issues and limitations.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
182	Exploring Motivation (W180)	Many organizations attempt to increase their productivity by the use of employee reward schemes. Over the years, an increasing body of research has grown suggesting that the use of rewards to move individuals to action may have negative effects on their team working and the quality of their work products in the long term.\n\nThe objective of the session is to raise awareness of the impact that development practices can have on intrinsic motivation, and to identify ways that the practices in different software development methods (such as RUP, SCRUM, XP, Open Source) affect motivation within teams. Participants will pool their experience to come up with patterns (or anti-patterns) that nurture intrinsic motivation within teams.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
183	Clearing Communication Logjams (W180)	Under a heavyweight process, two individuals can work on the same problem and communicate primarily through the buffer of a 2-inch document. As agile teammates, they would rely instead on many short conversations. Compared to their heavyweight counterparts, it is even more vital for members of an agile team to focus on communication, since the quality of communication relates directly to how smoothly the agile project flows. If communication bogs down, and logjams appear, the agile teammates must unblock themselves to stay on track.\n\nWorkshop participants will examine specific and common problems that arise in everyday interactions within teams practicing agile methodologies. Participants will share and assess one another's approaches to a spectrum of communication logjam scenarios.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
184	Architectures and Technologies for Agile Development of Enterprise Applications (W90)	Let's cut through the hype and talk about what has really worked. Which technological and architectural choices have best facilitated agile development - early and continuous delivery, at a pace sustainable forever, of valuable, working, simply-designed software, to ever-changing requirements - in the context of enterprise applications?\n\nIn this workshop we'll examine that issue, by breaking down the measures of success of an agile development organization, and correlating architectural and technological choices to performance against those measures, on projects we've experienced. We'll split into small groups to share sanitized characterizations of projects where we've seen correlations, positive or negative, and we'll compile matrices of correlations between such choices and the success measures we break down. We'll describe architectural refactorings we had to do, why we had to do them, and what the end state looked like.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
185	Introducing Agile Practices (G90)	Before you can succeed with an agile project, you must first succeed in introducing an agile process to your organization. As news about agile processes spreads, more organizations are becoming intrigued and are ready to dip a toe into agile waters. The goal of this goldfish bowl discussion will be to share experiences and look for common answers to questions such as:\n\nWhat is the best way to convince an organization to try an agile process?\n\nWhat types of projects are appropriate for a company's first agile project?\n\nWhat are the most important things to do during the first 60 days?\n\nHow do we measure success?\n\nWhat obstacles are we likely to meet? How do we overcome them?\n\nShould we start with an established agile process or should we customize our own?\n\nHow do we handle reluctant or skeptical programmers, customers or bosses?\n\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
186	Experience the Transition to an Agile Organization (S180)	Our experience on several XP projects over the past four years has led us to believe that strong management and organizational change is critical to successful adoption and application. Because traditional command-and-control management doesn't align well with XP, a more appropriate agile approach is needed.\n\nIn this simulation, participants will simulate a greeting card company. Working together, they will produce greeting cards to specification. The goal of the simulation will be to draw out the differences between traditional and agile organizations to gain a deeper understanding of agile organizational principles.\nVisit CC Pace Systems at http://www.ccpace.com to learn more, or go to Electroglide http://www.webdc.com to check out detailed simulation material.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
187	Successful Customer Involvement (W180)	Do you want to collaborate effectively with your customers? Use "appreciative inquiry" to harvest wisdom from the best of your own experiences with them.\n\nCustomer involvement is essential for agile projects. We involve customers in chartering (visioning) and planning releases, defining requirements or stories, creating customer scenarios or stories for testing, conducting prototypes, running and checking acceptance tests, and retrospecting (debriefing) iterations and the project as a whole, and more. Using an appreciative inquiry approach, we'll explore the best ways to actively and positively involve customers and users in your project, from beginning to end.

188	Are Design Patterns Dead? (G90)	Designs are emerging; small refactorings add flexibility when and where it's needed; the tests tell you where to go. Do design patterns still have a place in an agile world? Some argue the nail is already in the coffin, others contend design patterns thrive in an agile environment. Proponents of these two positions will square off to convince one another of their views. We'll debate Small Up Front Design, its general appropriateness and whether patterns have a role to play, along with the technique of Refactoring to Patterns spearheaded by Joshua Kerievsky.	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
189	Tool Support for Agile Development: Hi Tech vs Low Tech (T90)	Agile development strives to respond better to the software needs of the customer. And in doing so, agile developers use a variety of tools, some technological typically surrounding the creation, testing, and delivery of the software, and others involving ways of communicating and working with people. In some cases, high-tech and low-tech tools can be brought to bear to solve the same or similar problem in agile development.\n\nThe aim of this think tank is to debate whether high-tech or low-tech tools are the best avenues to supporting and improving an agile process. Participants will contribute their own experiences as well as learn from the experiences of others.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
190	Requirement Specifications in Agile Projects (T180)	Although "requirements as conversation" works for some organizations, many places still need a written document that can be referred to. Creating an appropriate weight document for Agile projects is the purpose of this session. Specifically this session will look at the enduring specification artifacts that should be preserved by projects as an essential organizational memory of Agile projects.	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
191	What Should Students Know About Agile Development? (W180)	As agile practitioners, we know the practices and dispositions necessary for an individual to successfully participate in an agile team. Can we convey this understanding to academia? What do we believe students need to know in order to prepare them for doing agile development? What do we want to see in fresh-out students?\n\nThis collaborative session is designed to start this conversation and produce a set of concrete assertions, guidelines and suggestions that are grounded in our experiences as industrial practitioners of agile development.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
192	What We Have Learned about Agile Methods (W90)	For the past year, the Center for Empirically Based Software Engineering (CeBASE) has sponsored three online “eWorkshops” on agile methods. The purpose of each workshop was to build up decision support for software developers. Each eWorkshop started with and then refined a handful of “heuristics” that attempted to describe basic assumptions about the nature of agile methods and how they could be best used for various types of projects.\n\nUsing some of the heuristics that resulted from the eWorkshops as a starting point, participants in this session will have the opportunity to contribute their own experiences to refine or expand the list of heuristics.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
193	Retrospectives (S90)	A retrospective is a meeting, where a team looks back on a past period of work so that they can learn from their experience and apply this learning to future projects. Some agile teams run retrospectives at the end of successive iterations rather than at the end of a project. The benefits of running retrospectives every few weeks rather than months are improved communication across teams and early feedback on development practice.\n\nThe objective of this session is to explain the benefits of holding regular retrospectives and give guidance on how to run a retrospective. Participants will get practical experience of how to run a retrospective, using the conference as the subject for reflection.\n	Technical Exchange	Talk	2003
194	Interaction Design Meets Agility	Focal to most agile development approaches is the notion that development work done is described in terms of its understandable value to the users of the software. Yet there's little written in documented agile methods on exactly how to discover and understand these "users". Our once well understood systems architecture has taken a backseat to these often poorly understood "users" and the features they need to generate business value. Interaction Design methodologies such as Constantine & Lockwood's Usage-Centered Design offer valuable approaches for finding, classifying, and prioritzing the people who have goals your software can help fulfill.\nThis tutorial will acquaint participants with U-CD and its place in an agile development approach. As a participant, you'll be working hands-on in a collaborative design team to produce a user role model using 3x5 cards, poster paper, discussion, and creativity. You'll learn how the role model helps build context around software features that help determine priority and make trade-off decisions throughout a development project.

195	Scrum and Agile Process 101	Focal to most agile development approaches is the notion that development work done is described in terms of its understandable value to the users of the software. Yet there's little written in documented agile methods on exactly how to discover and understand these "users". Our once well understood systems architecture has taken a backseat to these often poorly understood "users" and the features they need to generate business value. Interaction Design methodologies such as Constantine & Lockwood's Usage-Centered Design offer valuable approaches for finding, classifying, and prioritzing the people who have goals your software can help fulfill.\nThis tutorial will acquaint participants with U-CD and its place in an agile development approach. As a participant, you'll be working hands-on in a collaborative design team to produce a user role model using 3x5 cards, poster paper, discussion, and creativity. You'll learn how the role model helps build context around software features that help determine priority and make trade-off decisions throughout a development project.

203	Skills for the Agile Designer	Don’t be complacent with just refactoring your code towards an adequate solution. Agile designers need to be skilled problem solvers and communicators (and no, that doesn’t mean just writing clean code or producing barely enough UML). Increase your agility by adopting new techniques for seeing and articulating problems, shaping solutions, and explaining your designs. This tutorial will present strategies for finding and characterizing objects and their behavior, designing application control centers, adapting patterns, characterizing the essence of a problem, and telling good design stories. Key techniques will be reinforced with brief exercises.\nRecognizing and adapting to different design rhythms is an often overlooked key to agility. When things don’t exactly go according to plan, agile designers react, readjust their thinking, and try again. Even so, unanticipated problems crop upwicked problems that can’t be solved by sheer effort alone. They require a blend of skills: creative problem solving, negotiation, the ability to craft-try-rethink-and-propose solutions that combine simpler ideas or possibly take a leap in a totally new direction. This tutorial concludes with practical advice on how to sort design problems into the core, the revealing, and the rest, so you can give each kind of problem the attention it deserves.

212	An Initial Exploration of the Relationship Between Pair Programming and Brooks’ Law	Through his law, “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later,” Brooks asserts that the assimilation, training, and intercommunication costs of adding new team members outweigh the associated team productivity gain in the short term. Anecdotes suggest that adding manpower to a late project yields productivity gains to the team more quickly if the team employs the pair programming technique when compared to teams where new team members work alone. We utilize a system dynamics model which demonstrates support of these observations. Parameter values for the model were obtained via a small-scale, non-probabilistic, convenience survey. Our initial findings suggest that managers should incorporate the pair programming practice, particularly when growing their team.	Research	Research Paper	2004
213	Exploring Extreme Programming in Context: An Industrial Case Study	A longitudinal study evaluating the effects of adopting the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology was performed at Sabre Airline Solutions™. The Sabre team was a characteristically agile team in that they had no need to scale or re-scope XP for their project characteristics. The case study compares two releases of the same product. One release was completed just prior to the team’s adoption of the XP methodology and the other after approximately two years of XP use. Comparisons of the new release project results to the old release project results show an increase in design complexity, a 50% increase in productivity, a 65% improvement in pre-release quality, and a 30% improvement in post-release quality. These findings suggest that, over time, adopting the XP process can result in increased productivity and quality.	Research	Research Paper	2004
214	The XP Customer Role in Practice: Three Studies	The Customer is the only non-developer role in eXtreme Programming (XP). The Customer's explicit responsibilities are to drive the project, providing project requirements (user stories) and quality control (acceptance testing): unfortunately the customer must also shoulder a number of implicit responsibilities including liason with external project stakeholders, especially project funders, clients, and end users, while maintaining the trust of both the development team and the wider business. In this paper, we report on a series of case studies of the Customer role in XP projects. We have found that Customers have a pressured and stressful role, leading to issues of sustainability.

215	Agile Methods for Large Organizations  Building Communities of Practice	Agile development practices respect tacit knowledge, make communication more effective, and thus foster knowledge creation process. However the current agile methods, like XP, are focused on practices that individual teams or projects need and use of the methods in organizations consisting of multiple co-operating teams is difficult. Community of Practice theory suggests that large agile organization should have various overlapping informal cross-team communities. This paper studies three agile methods, developed in Nokia, that use facilitated workshops to solve multi-team issues. Using Communities of Practices theory paper explains why these methods work in multi-team settings. The results of this paper suggest that workshop practices that gather people from different parts of organizations together to perform a specific well-defined task can be used effectively to solve issues that span over multiple teams and to build up Communities of Practice. This result suggests that the Community of Practice concept could provide basis for adapting agile methods for the needs of large organizations.	Research	Research Paper	2004
216	Direct Verbal Communication as a Catalyst of Agile Knowledge Sharing	This paper discusses the role of conversation and social interactions as the key element of effective knowledge sharing in an agile process. It also presents the observations made during a repeated experiment on knowledge sharing conducted in various groups of professionals and students. The study suggests that the focus on the pure codified approach is the critical reason of Tayloristic team failure to effectively share knowledge among all stakeholders of a software project. Drawing on the knowledge-as-relationship perspective of knowledge sharing we theorize that verbal face-to-face interaction facilitates achieving higher velocity accomplishments by software development teams.

217	XP "Anti-Practices" : anti-patterns for XP practices	When you introduce XP to your project, the team gets fresh enegy and high efficiency. However, sustaining the good condition becomes difficult when you are attacked by its side effects. We call these XP side effects "Anti-Practices", just as well as we name "Anti-Patterns" for Patterns.\n"Turning all the knobs up to 10" is the XP way, but Anti-Practices show bad symptoms of the overdrive. (There is a proverb "more than enough is too much" in Japan.)\nIn this experience report, we identify Anti-Practices discovered from our projects with prescriptions to the symptoms so that XPers can share the counter plans.

218	Refactoring the Development Process: Experiences with the Incremental Adoption of Agile Practices	The goal of many current process improvement efforts is to become more agile by adopting an agile process. However, the results of several recent projects suggest that when attempting to become more agile, adopting an agile process is exactly the wrong thing to do!\nIn this experience report, we discuss our failures with wholesale process adoption and our successes using an incremental adoption strategy based on metric- and retrospection-driven feedback. Similar to refactoring practices for design and code, this strategy identifies “process smells,” and targets the worst of them with specific agile practices drawn from several popular agile processes.

219	Subclassing XP: Breaking its rules the right way	XP says that all of its practices are mandatory. Fine, subclass XP and create a new methodology.\nFor each XP practice you remove you need a compensating one.\nWe removed pair programming and replaced it with pairing. A pair has an author and a second. Design must be paired, but only by the completion of the story. Formal pair programming can ensue at the option of the author or the second.\nWe also replaced individual or pair refactoring with group-controlled refactoring. A refactor list is maintained and prioritised by the group and worked on towards the end of the iteration.	Process Evolution (XR1)	Experience Report	2004
220	Learning Effective XP: Successes and Failures	Agile processes such as XP (eXtreme Programming) have been recognised for their potential benefits of greatly improving software vis-à-vis fewer bugs, early delivery of valuable functionality, closer client/programmer interaction and a lower cost/change curve. As with any process, factors such as experience, time pressures and project scale influence its success or failure. In this paper, we describe the experiences of five different teams that adopted XP in small projects. Project teams were made up of four or five programmers, who were from various backgrounds, with varying levels of experience. The experiments were conducted as part of a postgraduate degree course in a university.\nEach team had differing levels of success. In determining the dominant features of both the successful and unsuccessful projects, we observed that many of the XP principles can be applied in a way that detrimentally affects the project. This paper discusses the learning curve associated with the XP process and how inexperienced teams can misinterpret the guidelines. We argue that this is due to the fact that teams do not appreciate the underlying ethos upon which these principles are based. This paper presents experiences that show how a naïve application of the XP guidelines can greatly affect the success of a project.	Agile Challenges (XR2)	Experience Report	2004
221	Emergent Database Design : Liberating Database Development with Agile Practices	Many agile projects do not apply agile practices to their database development.  Common wisdom dictates that the entire data model be carefully designed up front and protected from change thereafter.\nWe believed the common wisdom as well. But the clash of traditional database practices and agile development practices caused us significant pain, and hamstrung our ability to deliver the most business value in each iteration.\nOnce we recognized this pain, we abandoned the conventional wisdom. Incrementally, we applied agile discipline to our database development, eventually reducing up-front design work to just-in-time work that matched our 1 to 2 week development iterations.\nThis paper summarizes our experience.

Embedded development (i.e. firmware) projects are quite different from object-oriented and pure software endeavors, yet they face many of the same challenges that Agile software development practices address. Several unique challenges are described, including team members’ specialized domain knowledge, technical backgrounds and attitudes toward change, and the impact hardware plays in firmware design. We found Agile approaches to be well-suited for our project, in spite of the fact that most Agile methodologists come from very different backgrounds.	Agile Challenges (XR2)	Experience Report	2004
223	Aligning Strategic Planning with Agile Development	In my experience, I have successfully used Agile Development to build quality software, but often these projects have failed to bring about company success. This failure is due to the fact that most companies’ strategic planning capabilities have not been aligned with the flexibility and adaptability of Agile Development. I believe that Agile Development alone is insufficient to make every software project successful; every project must be coupled with a complimentary strategy to achieve business goals. If Agile Development is to continue growing in the business community, current strategic planning capabilities must be developed that share the same agile philosophies.

224	Adaptive Agility - Managing Complexity and Uncertainty	Landmark Graphics has a large portfolio of software projects, with over 60 commercial products consisting of over 50 million lines of code. We sought to improve our software development process and looked to agile methods as natural extension of our current processes. As we examined our past projects we realized that an overall process to suit all projects would need to be adaptable based on the project conditions. This led us to look at some of the ideas of Cockburn in Crystal methods, and later to the work of Boehm and Turner.\nUpon reviewing our projects, we realized that we could categorize them into a four quadrant matrix with the axes of Complexity and Uncertainty, where Complexity included such issues as team size and criticality, and Uncertainty included both market and technical uncertainty. As is tradition, we used animal names to represent the four quadrants:\nDogs  Small projects with low uncertainty\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tColts  Small projects with high uncertainty\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCows  Large projects with low uncertainty\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBulls  Large projects with high uncertainty\nAll projects might have core processes that they adopt, but many process activities should be adapted based on the elements of Complexity and Uncertainty. It was comforting to uncover that most of our project teams had already naturally taken on this emergent behavior.	Management (XR3)	Experience Report	2004

227	The Development Game	Three years ago we started a new project at our company. Undermanned, short on time, and under the gun to succeed, we started with 12 developers made up of existing domain experts and new technology experts. Management decided that the new project was the perfect time to implement some much needed process and, after investigating several published processes began implementing practices deemed important to success. I was on both the management and development teams.\nThe developers resisted the idea of new processes and practices for weeks, with quiet grumbling and out-and-out defiance.\nTo move forward, we created a "game" that involved developers in the process, rewarding approved practices and mildly disciplining non-compliance. Management spotted us $1,400 in prize money, which we used to buy techno-gadgets that would serve as rewards at the end of the iteration.\nThe game worked, and we developed a competitive and fun environment that improved morale, increased compliance, and caused the developers to become more involved in how the process itself worked. This paper describes the game and our experiences in playing it on several occasions.	Transitioning to Agile (XR4)	Experience Report	2004

We discovered that even inexperienced team members could contribute productively if there were test methods tailored for agile embedded software development, and real teamwork. Embedded systems are notoriously hard to troubleshoot.\nTest practices we describe in this paper made troubleshooting so easy that our bug list never had more than 2 entries throughout the whole project.

230	Don't Mock Me: Design Considerations for Mock Objects	Mock objects, an object-oriented testing construct used predominantly in test-driven development, are often abused, leading to inflexible and defective systems. Developers abuse mocks because they don't fully understand the driving forces for when to use and not use them; they also don't fully understand the implications of their improper use. Mocks inherently introduce design concessions in code.\nThis experience report discusses when to use mocks, presents design categories that most mock implementations fall into, and discusses the considerations for each design category.

The participants in this workshop will explore which core best practices and patterns are prerequisites for having an effective agile process, and how an agile team’s approach to the practice would differ from that of a more traditional environment. For example, “Version control” is arguably a process that helps a team; what is a core set of knowledge that an agile team needs to implement version control in a way that helps, not hinders the process? How does that differ from a more traditional environment? What are good resources for an agile team to use.\nThe workshop will start off with the group developing a set of core areas that they want to discuss in detail, and then we will explore the areas in depth.

234	Making money with (or without) software: Towards zero degrees of customer separation	Have you ever noticed how easy it is to write software tools for yourself?  This is because there are zero (0) degrees of separation between you (the developer) and you (the end-user and stakeholder).\nStakeholders pay for the privilege developers enjoy as a tool-builder.\n\nThis is how software teams are paid.\n\nIf we sold chickens, we would say, “these chickens are healthy and plump, and therefore worth more than this sickly, scrawny old cow”.\n\nMany Agile projects involving more than one person deliver on time and on schedule with high quality, yet fail to satisfy the project stakeholders.  All too often we find ourselves with an unhealthy cow when the market was demanding chicken.\n\nThe purpose of this workshop is to explore the topic, “Directly involving developers with customers makes money”.

240	Defining Agile Testing Practices, Rules, and Patterns	There are many testers on agile teams these days, and despite the increase in presentations and publications on “agile testing”; we find the term is still vague.  A list of agile testing practices (or patterns, rules of the game, whatever is the best way to express them) would guide us and other agile testers in the way XP practices guide XP teams.\nThe goal of this workshop is to discuss and produce a list of practices, rules, patterns (or however we choose to define agile testing techniques) that we (the workshop participants) agree upon.  We’ll use a list we’ve compiled as a starting point, but expect many ideas to surface in our discussions.	Peer to Peer	Workshop	2004
241	Agile Development with Domain Specific Languages	A domain-specific language is designed to express the requirements or solutions of a particular business domain.\nThe insurance industry, telephony, ice-cream manufacture, etc, all have their own vocabulary, constraints and patterns which can be most conveniently expressed in a purpose-made language. With clever engineering, we can design a compiler and runtime framework that can input such definitions and generate an insurance/telephony/ice-cream system.\n\nWith such a system at our disposal, creating our next insurance or ice-cream system becomes very rapid: development jobs become small-scale, that would be considered large scale if done from scratch; and consequently much more amenable to agile methodology. This workshop will explore that proposition.	Peer to Peer	Workshop	2004

8716	Lean UX: Getting out of the deliverables business	Traditionally UX Design has been a deliverables practice. Wireframes, sitemaps, etc defined the practice of UX Design (IA, IxD, UI Design etc). While this work has helped define what a UX Designer does and their value, it has also put designers in the deliverables business   measured & compensated for the quality of their deliverables (instead of the success of the experiences they design).\\n\\nEnter Lean UX - the practice of bringing the experience to light faster, with less emphasis on deliverables and greater focus on the actual experience being designed.\\n	User Experience & Interaction Design	Talk	2011
8736	Critical Success Factors for Acceptance Test Driven Dev't	A good analyst knows what questions to ask to bring clarity to a murky subject. When they hear about Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), a core practice on Agile projects, they ask: "Can examples capture functional requirements?, Where do user stories come from?, and Will my role become extinct? . When Jennitta Andrea worked on her first Agile project in 2000, she asked all of these questions and more. As a hands-on practitioner and keen observer of teams and processes, she has discovered success comes from knowing how ATDD is part of an eco-system of roles, practices, and tools.   	Agile Boot Camp	Talk	2011
8739	Agile In a Nutshell	If you ve been doing Waterfall delivery most of your career agile can be down right scary: changing requirements, adaptive planning, iterative development.  These are all intimidating things for managers and organizations used to doing things in discrete phases one stage at a time.  In this introductory talk, we will look at agile in simple terms explaining:\\n\\n- what agile is\\n- what working on an agile project is like\\n- some of it's myths\\n- which agile method is right for you, and\\n- three steps you can take to becoming more agile today.	Agile Boot Camp	Talk	2011
8741	The Potential For Agile Digital Marketing Business Strategy	David Dalka worked at BlackRock (BLK) during the 80 to 800 person hyper growth phase redefining data structures, agile financial analysis and reducing decision making cycle times. After 9/11 events, David started studying businesses that were failing after not adopting emerging best practices using digital, search marketing and emerging media techniques. He advocates that agile BlackRock style techniques be applied to marketing processes to optimize business performance. David will discuss emerging digital marketing business strategy. Senior business leaders are encouraged to attend!	Business & Project Management	Demonstration	2011
8745	Building a Practice as a UX Team of One	UX teams of one have unique challenges. Fewer resources. Creative isolation. Organizational ignorance. Sometimes even hostility. This workshop will explore the real life agile team situations that solo UX practitioners work in, and show what you can do about them.\\n\\nThe goal of this workshop is to give every attendee the tools to be relevant and effective by creating a personalized plan for their UX practice. Your plan will include the methods, soft skills, and strategies that will help you build support for UX and do your best work in an agile environment.	User Experience & Interaction Design	Tutorial	2011
8747	Tightening the Feedback Loop	Agile methods bring individuals working together in a more intimate environment than other methods. It requires different skills to make it work. Giving and receiving effective feedback is a powerful tool  to improve collaboration in teams and organisations yet our organisations teach us little about this important topic. We are surrounded by poor examples all the time.We'll explore some simple rules for giving and receiving feedback, observe how most people give ineffective feedback to others and illustrate examples of applying the rules to make it more effective.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
8750	Fluency over Proficiency: Accelerating Agile Learning and "Hunting Fluency"	While we value proficient knowledge of Agile practices, we value more the fluent, skillful expression of these practices and principles in daily use. \\n\\nExperience team and individual learning in this interactive session, via a toolkit of accelerated learning and teaching techniques. Used together, these techniques comprise a coaching and peer-to-peer mentoring language that drives ever-tighter cycles of improvement. \\n\\nCome to this experiential workshop for immersion in accelerated learning using the Language Hunting fluency game system.\\n	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
8751	What are we supposed to do with these managers NOW?	Your organization has begun the journey of adopting agile. Most of the practices learned focus on the team. However, how do those teams become self-organized? Isn t some kind of leadership useful to help them along? Since teams represent all functional groups, where does that leave manager? Do we need them any more? In this session, we will explore areas where management can be valuable such as team organization, team space, mentorship and process optimization. If you are a manager, there is a place in an Agile organization if you are willing to look at responsibilities in a different way.	Leadership	Talk	2011
8752	Goad Testing: Guaranteeing that Tests Make Distinctions	Test Driven Development has reached maturity.  Goad Testing takes you a level deeper, examining what tests really are and using the outcome of that exercise to derive new ways of keeping software - both production and test - healthy, flexible, and on-specification.\\n\\nMaking distinctions is a critical aspect of a test: It allows a test to serve as an executable specification.  Sometimes this ability is lost in the course of maintenance.  Goad testing is a way to prevent that from happening without introducing significant extra work or complexity.	New Horizons & New Voices	Demonstration	2011
8760	SHU-HA-RI Applied to Agile Leadership Driving Your Agile Evolution	Far too many agile instances either fail or are challenged because leadership team members don t sufficiently understand the fundamentals of agility nor how to map them towards effective execution. In this presentation, we ll explore a basic assessment model for determining Agile Leadership Maturity as a means of assessing and improving their understanding and your overall effectiveness. Not as a means of stereotyping leadership, but simply as a tool for understanding the leadership maturity landscape within your organization. Then we'll develop context-based strategies for improvement.	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
8764	Manager as Scrum Master?	Self-managing is very important aspect in Agile change, in which manager transforms from command & control to leading and coaching. The experience report will share you a 3-year journey from one large-scale organizational Agile adoption, with the focus on the evolution of Scrum Master and manager role and the way they work together. It describes how the change regarding self-managing was introduced and adapted, then how they have tried to sustain the change by creating consistency between the values and principles behind Agile organization and the management capability to practice them.\\n	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
8765	Apply systems thinking in large-scale Scrum transformation	In large-scale Scrum transformation, organizations experience gridlock after the initial success. System thinking is one important thinking tool that will help you see the dynamic view of the system and get over the challenges. Through the workshop, you will learn to recognize common system archetypes, so that you understand why you are getting certain undesirable effects; as well as common strategies to leverage in the situation, so that you direct your effort on the right place.	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
8773	The surprising science behind agile leadership	Not everyone is a fan of the self directed self organizing team. It flies in the face of traditional project management, and often conflicts with the traditional organization model. The benefits of self directed teams however are too big to ignore and now we have scientific proof as to why. \\n\\nIn this new talk on agile leadership, I explain:\\n\\n- how and why agile leadership works, \\n- the science behind why so many choose to work this way, and \\n- the impact it s going to have on you and your organization.	Leadership	Talk	2011
8774	Lean Startup: How Development Looks Different When You're Changing the World	How does development look different when you're creating things that no one has ever created before? Lean Startup is about creating from a BIG VISION, where we want to change the world & do something really significant. It combines Agile Development with _Customer_ Development so we can be disciplined about how we create our startups. Learning (rather than working software) becomes our most important measure of progress and agile practices are pushed to the next level. Come get a glimpse of the next level of agile and discover how development looks different when you're changing the world.	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
8780	Adaptive Leadership: Accelerating Organizational Agility	Leading agile organizations requires Adaptive Leadership that begins with understanding business agility and how practices like continuous delivery and a mindset of sustainable agility combine to create highly responsive IT organizations. Adaptive Leadership is two dimensional: Being and Doing Agile. Adaptive leaders embrace specific principles and practices, such as "doing" four key performance levers:  Do Less,   Speed-to-Value,   Quality,  and  Engage , and  Being  agile "adaptive", "riders of paradox", "exploring", and "facilitating." \\n\\n	Enterprise Agile	Tutorial	2011
8782	Dr W. Edwards Deming's famous Red Bead Experiment - For Software Teams	Participate in Dr W. Edwards Deming's famous Red Bead Experiment. This classic learning tool helps illustrate the impact that a system, and traditional management approaches, can have on individuals who work within an organisation. I will also relate this experiment to approaches to software development and the management of software development teams. \\n\\nThe experiment introduces many of Deming's ideas about management, including his 14 Points for Management. It also introduces the Statistical Process Control Chart.\\n\\nAfter the experiment there will be a discussion of the issues addressed. 	Open Jam	Demonstration	2011
8785	Becoming Agile in an Imperfect World	Taking a big bang approach to Agile is not a viable option for most organizations. Most successful adoptions of Agile are tailored to the strengths and limitations of the organization. This workshop will show you how to design a tailored roadmap to becoming Agile, despite the constraints around you. The roadmap includes 3 phases; Getting Ready, Piloting and Spreading Agile. If you re just starting your agile transition or in a transition stage, this workshop will equip you with practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process without starting from scratch.\\n\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Tutorial	2011
8797	Hooray, We're Agile Testers! What's Next? Advanced Topics in Agile Testing	Your team successfully adopted Agile, you have traction on practices such as CI, TDD, maybe ATDD. Still, you see lots of room for improvement in testing. Do you sometimes miss or misunderstand customer needs? Is it sometimes hard to complete all testing activities each iteration? In this interactive tutorial, you'll practice ways to better understand and capture customer needs; collaborate more effectively and enjoyably with developers and other team members;  improve continuous integration and delivery; manage technical debt; plan and estimate in ways that ensure testing \\"keeps up\\". \\n\\n	Testing & Quality Assurance	Tutorial	2011
8798	Coaching at the Enterprise Level - Introducing the Agile Cafe	Agile coaches are leaders of change in an organization and we leverage things like training, direct coaching expertise on Agile, and facilitating peer-to-peer networks to help with this change.   There is a gap in the current literature on how to create such networks.  This talk will cover the Agile Cafe, my version of the World Cafe, in both theory & practice.   The World Cafe is a technique to gather groups of people together, ask them important questions, and draw out their knowledge.  Outcomes are shared knowledge, community creation, and visibility for Agile at the enterprise level.  \\n\\n	Coaching & Mentoring	Talk	2011
8800	Learning From Failure Overpowers Fear	You ve started with Agile, and you re doing ok, some lows, some deeper insights. During an agile transition most people come face to face with something they fear.  It may be a concept, thought, activity or belief that is challenged.\\nI m going to tell you about some fears and failures that teams, Product Owners and Scrum Masters encounter. Along the way you will hear about my agile transition journey and how embracing fear and failure has given me this overwhelming feeling of being free and full of energy!\\n\\n\\n\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
8801	The Speed To Cool: Agile Testing And Building Quality In	Ensuring that the approach to testing and quality is understood and appropriately valued in an agile world can be a struggle for many organisations, especially when resources are limited and our customers are expecting business value in a timely manner. In this session we will define what quality means and share a number of tools for measuring it, discuss approaches to improving the skills, empowerment and role of testing in the organisation and share why testing is the coolest role on the team and why it is everyones responsibility.	Testing & Quality Assurance	Talk	2011
8808	Designing a Kanban System for the Enterprise	Enterprise software and systems development typically involves complex mixes of teams, technologies, skills, architectures and organisational structures which must interact for the business to be successful. This tutorial will introduce an approach which designs the Enterprise as a Kanban System. The model is based on the central theme of Systems Thinking, the purpose of achieving Pull, Value and Capability, and aspects of Workflow, Visualisation, Work In Process, Cadence and Learning. The model is not a complete solution, but suggests key areas to consider when designing the Agile Enterprise.	Enterprise Agile	Tutorial	2011
8810	WIP and Kaizen:  Key Tools for Enabling Continuous Improvement 	Have you established an Agile or Lean software development approach including conducting retrospectives but you just don't seem to be able experience meaningful innovation and improvement in your process?  This talk will explore some of the reasons why this could be and provides a pragmatic approach to helping ensure your process can support innovation and continuous improvement\\n\\n\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
8821	Beyond Software: Adopting Agile Outside of Development	The challenges and benefits of adopting agile in software development are well known. Conceptually it makes a hell of a lot of sense for departments outside of dev to embrace agile as well. However, as organizations extend agile into sales, marketing, professional services and hr they need to leverage the experience of their software teams while understanding that not every agile practice translates exactly. This session will focus on how to help build an agile sales/marketing/professional services/hr team when no one has ever been on an agile sales/marketing/professional services/hr team.	Business & Project Management	Workshop	2011
8823	An Introduction to Non-Violent Communication (NVC) for Agile Coaches	NVC can dramatically improve our relationships by helping us focus our attention on\\n1) Empathic understanding of others without compromising our own values, and\\n2) Expressing our real feelings and needs openly and honestly, yet without blame or criticism.\\n\\nNVC delineates four components of communication:\\n     1) Observations free of evaluations;\\n     2) Feelings straight from the heart;\\n     3) Needs, values and longings; and\\n     4) Requests expressed clearly in positive action language.\\n\\nThis session will show how NVC can be an important addition to your Agile coaching tool kit.	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
8831	Agile Decisions	Making the right choices is crucial. Decisions have generally been viewed as the prerogative of individuals - usually senior executive. The process employed, the information used, the logic relied on, have been left up to them, in something of a black box. Information goes in, decisions come out - and who knows what happens in between. Unlike other business processes, decision making has been rarely the focus of systemic thinking and analysis. This has left a significant opportunity to improve decision making as we would any other process through visibility, feedback and value.	Business & Project Management	Tutorial	2011
8832	Taming the customer support queue	In Aug 2010 we reduced the size of our development team. We needed to handle customer support issues and new development with the 3 remaining teams. We had over 600 open defects and the list was growing daily. On top of that our first clients were going live. Clearly some radical change was needed. We implemented Kanban. \\n\\nThe result? In Dec 2010 we had no open severity 1 issues. Our queue was down to 54 issues. SLAs are met in most cases, and our resolution rate exceeds our incoming rate.\\n\\nI d like to share our story, and inspire you to tame your support queue too!

8838	Flirting With Your Customers	Flirting is about connecting. Some universities require their IT engineers take a flirting class not to attract a partner, but to learn how to interact better in the workplace. \\n\\nWe ve translated flirting techniques for use in a business setting. Discover how the  8 flirting steps  can help you  create stronger connections and greater understanding of your customers so that you work together better to deliver business value.  Flirting With Your Customers  creates the connections that can make a significant difference in your project s success.

8840	Agile Management: creating a culture to help your team succeed	I'm the software development manager for a product company with 3 agile teams. My job is to foster the environment or culture that helps us be the best team we can be. In this talk I'll share a little about how I've done this, where I got my ideas, and how this works compared to other environments I've worked in which are.... well let's just say different :)\\n\\nI recently blogged about this: http://scrumcoaching.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/a-development-managers-strategy/	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
8845	Creativity for Agile Teams	This is a refinement of our presentation at Agile2009. Creativity can manifest in several ways including creation of something new, refinement of something that exists and problem solving. How do we support, enable and enhance the creative abilities of Agile teams? There are many ways to shape the work environment for greater creativity. We will describe how creativity happens and can be enhanced by providing a safe, nurturing environment, enhancing group interactions, pacing activities that utilize different sensory modes and trusting in the power of subconscious integration.\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
8848	Design Thinking	What does the US Military have in common with Apple? The both deal with increasing complexity by emphasizing design thinking. At Apple, design thinking starts by deciding, first of all, what NOT to do. In the military, design thinking precedes planning, and takes leaders through a series of steps that reframe their thinking about the environment they are dealing with. When you have competitors like Apple - or when your decisions are a matter of life or death - then you need to move beyond working software, beyond backlogs, even beyond agile - and focus like a laser on customers.	Working with Customers	Talk	2011
8849	Refactoring and Code Smells - An example of refactoring legacy code	Recognizing code smells and cleaning the code up by refactoring are essential skills of an agile developer. This session explains why these skills are so essential, introduces common code smells and shows refactorings that clean up the code. This will be demonstrated in the context of a piece of open-source legacy code (an accounting program in Java). I'll introduce code smells by identifying them in this piece of code, then apply refactorings to remove them. I'll keep identifying more code smells and refactor them until there is nearly nothing left of the original code.	Agile Boot Camp	Demonstration	2011
8854	Collaborating with Non-Collaborators	We understand the vital importance of collaboration among team members. However, how can we deal with non-collaborators people who won t work with us? Although we may not be able to change them, we may be able to work with them. This session describes how to identify non-collaborator and examine the system within which the non-collaborators work: their success factors, motivations and measurements. Using a Trust and Ownership Model, we considers tools and techniques to cope with each trait. Deal with non-collaborators by building a strategy that empowers you to collaborate no matter what.	Leadership	Tutorial	2011
8855	Teach Your Cucumber Scenarios to Speak "Business"	Cucumber can be a powerful tool to build a common, or ubiquitous, language between product people, developers, and testers. A common language leads to common understanding and, ultimately, more valuable software. Unfortunately, too many teams write Cucumber scenarios that use technical language and miss out on this benefit. In this interactive session, you'll learn how to use Cucumber to grow a ubiquitous language and how to refactor your existing scenarios to speak "business." (While the focus is on Cucumber, users of other tools will surely see ways to apply the lessons to their own tools.)	Testing & Quality Assurance	Tutorial	2011
8857	Removing Impediments with Drawings	Pictures convey ideas more clearly and have a greater impact than a simple conversation.  The ability to communicate, and perhaps sell, your ideas at a whiteboard is an essential skill for anyone on an Agile team.  In this hands-on session based on Dan Roam's book "The Back of the Napkin", we will learn the six types of diagrams used in business and how to select the right picture for your problem.  All you need for this session is an issue, your imagination and the ability to draw a circle, square, arrow and a stick figure.  Come on - give this a try.  It will be fun.	Coaching & Mentoring	Tutorial	2011
8858	Refactoring Conversation Smells	As an Agile practitioner, you probably communicate with many different people every day. Are all your conversations effective? Or do you sometimes find yourself or the other person explaining and re-explaining, arguing a position, fighting over  semantics , or cornered?\\n\\nThese conversations go awry in consistent ways, which arise from people's innate methods of processing and cataloguing information. Come to this tutorial to learn these "conversation smells" and systematic ways -- a simple set of patterns and questions -- to tackle them and get your conversations unstuck.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011
8859	Powerful Questions	Picking the right question or reframing an issue can introduce a profound shift in the conversation. In this hands-on workshop, we will discuss how to create your own powerful questions and practice this skill. Leave with a practical tool you can use with your Teams today.\\n\\n	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
8860	Creaky Platforms: tackling legacy technology challenges	Yesterday s state-of-the-art system is today s legacy. The advent of SaaS, social, mobile, etc prevents the rapid rollout of new features. Large or small, aligning product or platform with ever-changing business strategy is critical.  \\n\\nLarge or small, it is critical to understand how to align product or platform with an ever-changing business strategy. \\n\\nWe discuss how to balance the cost pressures to use legacy assets with the need to keep up with the market. We also reveal how to remediate legacy systems quickly without investing in a massive and risky 'big-bang' re-platforming.\\n	Enterprise Agile	Talk	2011
8867	Team Swarming--Why and How	Agile teams are often asked to swarm over the work, applying as many people to each item of work as productively possible before starting the next.  Sometimes this magically works, and bystanders confidently describe the team as "gelled." Other times it looks like a train wreck, with people getting in each other s way and on each other s nerves. In the middle we find a continuation of the status quo. What re the advantages of swarming? How can we increase the odds of gaining those advantages? We ll explore the answers from your experience and mine.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Workshop	2011

8876	Scaling Agile to the Enterprise with Lean	Lean is a journey, and Systematic began that journey five years ago. It started with an executive imperative, was kicked off with extremely successful Scrum pilots, spread to other teams using CMMI principles, then percolated up through middle management as success became obvious. This was certainly not easy! This is a story of a real lean journey taken by a large organization - the triumphs, the pitfalls, the honest results, the expansion as the company grew, the continuing saga of improvement. It's a story of lean theory, the struggle to implement that theory in practice, and the path ahead.	Enterprise Agile	Talk	2011
8877	Do you dare to ask your HR manager to practice KANBAN?	This is a true exercise.  We are a mid size software company in Sri Lanka.  Agile adoption of our development teams made our projects more profitable and sustainable. We got out of the  software factory  concept which is common in offshore business and built a professional software company. \\n But this didn t solve all our problems. With the rapid growth, we started to have a highly pressured situation in HR/operations depts. \\n This session covers how we introduced KANBAN to our HR/Op dept, the success, challenges and the difference I saw when applied them to dev teams.\\n	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
8881	IEEE Best Paper - Lean as a Scrum Troubleshooter	Systematic has relentlessly improved how it does Scrum during the past 5 years using the A3 problem solving tool from Lean. This approach is behind  the learning and experience reported in the past 5 years. This talk will take a walk behind the scenes of years of successful experiences and show the management and mechanics driving this learning. The cumulative learning from major improvements are presented, including a small set of measures that for the past 3 years has proven to be very valuable in monitoring project progress while at the same time fostering a Lean mindset in the teams.

8883	Test Driving and Unit Testing Thread Safety	It came as a shock to me when I tried to convince myself that the multithreaded code I was writing was not unit testable. It's too complex,  non-deterministic to be driven through tests, I told myself. I was so convinced I set out to show TDD does not apply here. But in the end, I proved myself wrong. In this zero-slides presentation, we will use TDD to drive the design of a multithreaded code. Along the way we'll hit some roadblocks, use those to learn some techniques and practices that'll help break the barriers. If you've confronted test driving for thread-safety this session is for you.

8887	The Emperor's New Clothes - Meaningful Interactions in Stressful Situations	See the Emperor in all his glory! Which role will you play? We all interact with different types of characters in our daily lives which may lead to stressful situations. Together, we will learn how to communicate more effectively with others, especially at times of stress, by transforming our behavior from incongruence to congruence. We will learn to recognise incongruence by role-playing the 5 Coping Stances based on the Satir Model, then learn how to begin transforming our behavior from one of incongruence to congruence by thinking about interactions in terms of Self, Other and Context.	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
8888	The Culture of Agility	Agility as a process is well understood today in feedback generating iterations or as a flow. Agility as a structure is becoming better understood through cross-functional teams working collaboratively. However, Agility as a culture has very little exposure - yet culture impacts every attempt at agility.\\n\\nThis session provides a language for organizational culture, its impact on agility, and examples where exposing culture has aided adoption. We explore cultures within single organizations, sub-cultures across boundaries within larger organizations, and cultures bridging a corporate merger.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011
8890	Embedded Testing Techniques	Contrary to widespread opinion, you *can* test on the target hardware. There are some challenges to doing so, though. This talk will focus on how I've been doing it since 2004.\\n\\nIn many cases, no modification to the target hardware is needed; in the remaining cases, the necessary modifications are quite minimal, well within the abilities of a programmer who's not afraid of soldering irons (adding one wire, usually).\\n\\nThe heavy-duty modifications will be to your test framework, and will be exclusively software. Example code from actual projects will be used to present them.	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Talk	2011
8900	Selling the Investment to Pay Down Technical Debt - The Code Christmas Tree	Sharing our experience in making code complexity and unit coverage visible in the hallway adjoining our team room and the conversations that happened around it.  Not only did it help to focus the team on the high debt areas of the application, but its red (bad) and green (good) coloring combined with its high-foot-traffic location enabled executives in this Fortune 500 insurance company to invest in paying down debt as well.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
8901	Ten Tales of Positive Change	These tales relate successful attempts at making improvements. They are described mostly in the order in which they occurred, from my time working in an Agile culture. The tales are about: \\n\\nCreating the Motivation to Pair Program  \\nStaying Focused at Stand-up  \\nKeeping Progress High and Questions Low  \\nReassigning Points to Validate Estimation  \\nAdmitting to the Real Date  \\nDealing With an Overwhelming Amount of Work  \\nGauging the Rate of Progress  \\nFiguring Out How to Construct Teams  \\nFinding Predictability in the Velocity  \\nAllowing for Cross-Functional Teams  \\n	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
8902	Deliberate Discovery Workshop	Ignorance is a constraint on many projects. We rarely know everything about our domain, processes, technology, politics, skills, expectations - the list goes on. As we progress we discover unexpected difficulties and find ourselves struggling to overcome them. Yet the unexpected always happens in different areas, no matter how much analysis we do. How much is enough? How can we target our greatest areas of ignorance to learn faster, and how can we keep our options open to cope with unknown unknowns? In this workshop we explore techiques for discovering, and handling, the unexpected.	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
8912	Agile 2.0 - Rebooting A Raccoon In An Imperfect World	On this 10th anniversary of agile, our community is struggling to address the issue of how to take experienced agile practitioners to the next level, while still providing training and tools to support those who are beginning their journey. With the "agile" word getting so overloaded, the challenge is to continually innovate without assigning labels.\\n\\nIn this talk we will discuss how to use the best of traditional, lean and agile methods to suit any team and showcase numerous patterns that demonstrate the best process to use is often a mixture of traditional practices and new innovations.\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
8917	Reverting to Form   How to Make Sure That Agile  Sticks 	Whether the adoption of Agile takes place in a grass-roots  bottom-up  approach or a mandated  top-down  manner, it takes a change in culture, and a willingness to  give it a chance  that is the biggest determinate in making Agile stick in an organization.  In particular, it is the acceptance of using business value as a pivot point that can make an organization realize that Agile is their friend, so long as they are willing to avoid the pratfalls that can drive an organization back to where it started.	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
8918	The Joy of Work:  Managing Performance, Innovation & Organizational Maturity	Do you find your work exciting and fulfilling?  Is your team rewarded for finding better ways to work? While many organizations have adopted Agile approaches at a project level, few have effectively aligned their HR processes with Agile values, or made finding better ways of working a truly rewarding and exciting proposition for their teams. Join us to explore the subject of creating a truly holistic performance management system that not only adheres to Agile principles, but actively promotes individual drive, team innovation and organizational maturity.	New Horizons & New Voices	Workshop	2011
8920	Sustaining Agility after the Coaches Leave	Transitioning to agile is hard. It involves learning new techniques, thinking in a different way, and stepping out of your comfort zone. No wonder so many agile transitions revert back to previous ways over time. A change in management or a loss of the agile champion is often a catalyst for this process. \\n\\nThis talk describes several mechanisms to help counteract these forces, and how to incorporate them into your organization. Presented through examinations of real-life examples, interactive exercises and open discussions, this talk provides guidance on how to create sustainable agility.\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
8921	'Super-Fresh' Code	The confluence of cloud computing, smart mobile devices, social networks and agile software methods transforms the nature of the business. The cloud enables offering everything as a service. Smart mobile devices consume those services and contribute to them in an  always on  mode. Social networks enable expert-sourcing on a per-task basis. When these three trends are combined in the right way with recent advances in Agile methods, the net result is  Super-Fresh  code. Such code serves as the source of competitive advantage for the modern company.\\n\\n	Business & Project Management	Workshop	2011
8923	Embedded TDD cycle - the first 3 years	James Grenning presented the embedded test-driven development (TDD) cycle already in 2004. Whispers on the hallways of conference hotels tell that somebody is actually implementing this idea. However, there are only few documented implementation details available. Schneider Electric s fire security team has been implementing TDD cycle as an integral part of the development process for 3 years. Come to learn from their real-life experience and mistakes in automated testing at different levels: unit testing, acceptance testing using simulation, and in real target hardware.	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Talk	2011
8924	Technical Debt: Assessment and Reduction	Do you really govern the software development process in your IT organization or do its uncertainty and unpredictability leave you, your internal customers and your company's customers aghast? Will technical debt play havoc with deployment dates you committed to and keep your development and operations staff from responding quickly and effectively to customer requests? Do you know how much money is required to "pay back" your software's technical debt? Once you take this workshop you will know how to quantify technical debt, rein it in, and mitigate its unpleasant consequences.\\n	Testing & Quality Assurance	Workshop	2011
8925	The Kata In The Hat	Programming is insanely hard. It s discipline. It's learning your katas from inside out. It's overcoming fear that you might write something buggy in a piece of software that will cost its owner millions of dollars. It is also fun, however. And while we do talk about it, we seldom do code for fun, just as a celebration of how much we love our coder s life. This session is an attempt to change this. We re going to code for fun. With the secret hope that some of the attendees will like what they ll see, decide it s the coolest thing to do, and make it happen everywhere on the planet.	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Demonstration	2011
8933	What's NXT? Agile Software/Hardware Integration	Developers never get to play with the cool toys. Now s your chance! This session explores architectural layering and unit testing strategies for a java application that controls a Lego® Mindstorms® NXT robot. Frequently teams that unit test utilize stub objects as substitutes for parts of the code that are not the focus of the test. Creating an architectural layer for the robot s hardware can be utilized for better unit tests and running the application without the hardware. Come get hands on and learn about these techniques using the robot and your pair partner.	Hands-on Learning	Tutorial	2011
8939	The Agile Leadership Kata: Discovering the Practice of Leadership	In software development, we use the term  practice  loosely compared to many other disciplines. It is as if by repeating the word  practice  we might somehow actually arrive at that professionalism that so many desire. How do you practice your skills as an agile team leader? What would that practice look like? \\n\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we will explore the techniques you can use to practice and hone your skills as a team leader. From individual exercises through collaborative games, we will explore how we can practice and improve our leadership skills.\\n	Leadership	Tutorial	2011
8945	How to Get Started with Agile When You Don't Know Where to Start	When transitioning to Agile, people often focus on how 'agile' you are instead of focusing on the reasons why you chose to 'go agile' in the first place. In this session we'll talk about a 3-step process to help you start or tune your adoption regardless if you're a 5 person or 5,000 person company. We'll talk about understanding the objectives for 'going agile', how to get educated about what that really means and how to create an execution strategy.  Attendees will create a worksheet to help them identify possible paths for transitioning based on their unique organizational parameters.	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
8950	Exploring Enterprise Agile Transformation Strategies	The goal of any enterprise agile adoption strategy is NOT to adopt agile. Companies adopt agile to achieve better business outcomes. Large organizations have no time for dogma and one-size-fits-all thinking when it comes to introducing agile practices. These companies need pragmatic guidance for safely and incrementally introducing structure, principles, and ultimately practices that will result in greater long term, sustainable business results. This talk will introduce a framework for safely, pragmatically, and incrementally introducing agile to help you achieve your business goals.  	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
8954	Own Up: the Product Stewardship model for UX 	Who is your project's Product Owner? What does that even mean? Are they ultimately favoring the voice of the business, its customers, your end-users, or the technologists? Where is the UX voice in your team?\\n\\nUX designers are uniquely positioned to solicit and evaluate input from business stakeholders, developers, and the people (potentially) buying and using our products. The Product Stewardship model allows a business stakeholder to focus on business value while empowering a Product Steward to balance human goals, business needs, and technical constraints and opportunities.	User Experience & Interaction Design	Talk	2011
8955	Introduction to Agile Planning and Project Management	Agile introduces a number of tools and techniques designed to help the team figure out how much software we can build for the time we have, and the amount of money our customer is willing to spend.  This talk will introduce the fundamental concepts necessary to break down and estimate our product backlog, how to organize delivery of that backlog for early risk reduction and rapid customer feedback, and how to get stable throughput and predictability as you mature your agile practices.  This talk is for those looking to understand how (and why) agile methods lead to better business outcomes.	Agile Boot Camp	Tutorial	2011
8967	Agile Requirements: To User Stories and Beyond!	Can extensive written requirements be dispensed with in favor of lighter weight 'stories'? It sounds easier, but can it really be as good? We'll start this session by staging a showdown between traditional and agile requirements.  Participants will form teams, create requirements documents, do development (no technical skill or computers needed), and evaluate the results. Next, participants will learn by doing, as we build a 3-part model for agile requirements: User Story, Conversation, and Acceptance Criteria. Participants will leave with a solid understanding, and practical skills.	Agile Boot Camp	Tutorial	2011
8968	Process Increments: An Agile Approach to Software Process Improvement	Process Increments, is an iterative approach to manage process improvement projects. This approach builds upon Agile values and principles, and reuses some well known Agile techniques. It partitions the scope into user-story-like increments, and manages the project using agile estimating and planning techniques.\\n\\nThis approach has been applied to five enterprises transitioning from individual-driven/non-structured organization to a team-work/structured organization. The study shows sustained improvement velocity, good project visibility, and on-going learning experiences by project teams.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
8969	Scaling Software Agility: Advanced Practices for Large Enterprise	Dean Leffingwell describes how rapidly advancing agile methods are being successfully applied to enterprise-class software development. He describes emerging practices including: lean requirements practices that scale to the full needs of the enterprise, intentionally-emergent enterprise architectures, a kanban system for re-architecting large-scale systems, achieving strategic alignment and product development flow with the Agile Release Train, and strategies for agile portfolio management and governance.\\n\\nsee. www.scalingsoftwareagility.com for more information.

8970	From Development Agility to Business Agility	Scrum is an effective approach for Agile Development. Opportunity Engineering (OE) is a business approach that allows to leverage uncertain business opportunities. We will present an effective framework that uses existing Development Agility and OE to enable real Business Agility. This framework uses Scrum to discover the right product to build by assessing business value under conditions of high-uncertainty (where real profits are). These concepts being already used by successful Internet companies, this presentation shows a ready-to-use framework applicable to any industry.	Business & Project Management	Tutorial	2011
8972	Design by Community: Involving Everyone in UX Design using Design Studio	The Design Studio method lets the whole team get involved in sketching and critiquing product solutions.  It s emerged as one of the agile-UX best practices for rapid design ideation and building whole-team ownership.  This hands-on workshop is a good fit for all project roles - veteran and novice alike!  Everyone will learn by participating in a design studio - exploring ideas for a real product.  You ll learn the process mechanics along with tips and tricks from experienced practitioners - everything you ll need to try this on your own project.	User Experience & Interaction Design	Tutorial	2011
8973	Chasing the constraint beyond the development team	Successfully adopting agile methods creates a high likelihood that the constraint in your value chain will migrate from software development to another business process. As your agile journey proceeds, more agile won t necessarily deliver continued improvements! Unfortunately, systemic improvement often takes considerable time and effort, and your agile effort may be seriously impaired while you work to improve a constraint that lies beyond your control. This workshop will address methods for identifying, predicting, and responding to organizational constraints beyond the development team.	Business & Project Management	Workshop	2011
8975	The Agile Office: Cisco's Unified Communications Business Unit	Agile transition is a period not an event. Structures are needed that will ensure agile survives long after the initial transition period.  Mike Cohn's keynote at Agile 2010 mentioned the concept of an 'Agile Office'. At the time we were over 2 years into our agile journey and 9 months into a formal organization-wide agile transition program. We knew we needed to create the support structures necessary to make sure that agile survived after the transition period, but weren t yet sure what form that would take. In September 2010 we formally launched the Cisco UCBU Agile Office.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
8976	The Budgeting Black Hole: Predicting the Unpredictable	An organization cannot run well without a budget. But a budget doesn t have to be a frustrating futile exercise in prediction. Incremental budgeting, specific management actions, along with project portfolio management provides everyone the data they need.\\n\\nWe will explore incremental budgeting in the context of a project, where we will periodically deliver value to the organization. We will see which work actually delivers value and can help predict budgets, and which work does not deliver value that helps with budgets. 	Adoption & Transformation	Tutorial	2011
8977	Basic Principle of the TPS and its Practical Ideas for Agile Software Process!	TPS developed in the 1950 s is a business model and collection of tactical methods to pursue high quality, low cost and short lead-time. It emphasizes to eliminate non-value added activities (waste) and to construct continuous flow processes. The TPS tools such as Kanban, Andon are only the tip of the iceberg. TPS is people centric system. It is more critical issues how to0change culture to involve people in Kaizen. Several ideas for better agile software development are presented from my experience of enhanced TPS development at Toyota.	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
8985	Risk Management Game: Shared Accountability Through Collaborative Risk Analysis	As we scale, it is imperative that everyone remain involved.  We must not fall back on old habits.   Risk management is often viewed as a vestige of plan-driven approaches but our agile flavor has proven valuable for helping teams make hard decisions collaboratively and proactively.\\n\\nWe introduce our risk management game, a powerful, collaborative and fun exercise for better results through collaboration.  We demonstrate that release planning is more than just stuffing stories into iterations.   You will take away hands-on knowledge of a technique useful up and down your agile enterprise.	Enterprise Agile	Tutorial	2011
8989	Scrum as a Thinking Toolkit	Leave aside, for the moment, the How of Scrum, those familiar roles & rituals, and come with me on a journey to discover the Why of Scrum.\\n\\nTogether we ll break apart Scrum practices upon the anvil of principles and values arriving at a destination I call  Scrum Thinking ; a place from where you can apply the science & purpose behind Scrum to organise your work & solve problems in disciplines & circumstances typically considered unsuitable to the application of the Scrum practices as they are applied to Software Development.	Business & Project Management	Workshop	2011
8991	Putting  the Fun Back In Your Retrospectives	Retrospectives are a key mechanism of a continuously improving process.  However it is a challenge to implement them well.  Many are poorly facilitated and just downright dull.  It doesn't have to be this way.  Retrospectives can be a time for celebration, a time for fun and a time for team-building.\\n\\nIn this tutorial attendees will experience some of the techniques Rally coaches use to put the fun back in the retrospective including: Goldilocks and the Three Bears, The Break-Up Letter, Draw Me a Picture, Captions, Futurespectives, 5 Whys and Holding a Movie Conversation.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011
8994	Design Thinking - Does Your Company Need It to Survive?	Companies fail every day due to a lack of balance between  right now  need for profit and the need for R&D/innovation to survive and thrive long-term.  Design thinking has risen over the past decade as a loose body of thought addressing how to intentionally   by design   achieve this balance.  You should be acquainted with it because 1) your company may need it to survive; 2)  design thinking and agile address similar problems, and design thinking can be leveraged to improve agile success; and 3) agile is a great approach to practically implement design thinking for business success.	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
9001	Functional Management - There IS a place for it in Agile	With the adoption of Agile, many groups wonder whether functional managers are required any more. Even with self-organizing teams, functional managers are still an integral part of Agile, and their role has transformed into more of a coach than ever. This talk explores what I have seen as a traditional software manager and my experiences in leading Agile teams as their functional manager. It delves into the nuances that I have found that are required of this new form of manager, and how this needed leadership meshes well with and elevates self-directed teams.\\n\\n\\n 	Leadership	Talk	2011

9011	Silo Busting	Organizational silos are the source of the most pernicious dysfunctions you can find within any company. These divisions serve to isolate people in the organization within hyper-specialized roles. Ostensibly, we do this in order to help people succeed.\\n\\n\\nHowever, you can deliver a product successfully without compartmentalizing everyone and everything in an organization within an inch of its life. In this tutorial, we explore the causes of organizational silos, their impacts, and the strategies that you can employ to help mitigate their impact on your teams and within your organization.\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
9021	Intro to Test Driven Design (TDD) & Pair Programming Dojo	If you ve never been on a team that s fully bought into Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming, then you re missing out.  These teams tend to learn much faster from each other, be more cohesive, write more modular software with fewer defects, refactor with confidence, and are generally more fun to be on.\\n\\nCome experience what it's like to work on a team that's using XP dev practices.\\n\\nBring a laptop with wifi, and expect to have some fun!\\n	Agile Boot Camp	Tutorial	2011
9025	Flow Games	Flow is a core part of Lean and an important concept for Agile teams and organisations to understand. Flow is what helps us deliver value, from concept to cash, as soon as possible. This session will use a selection of games to emphasise the importance of flow, and generate discussion on how to achieve flow through collaboration within and across teams.	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
9029	Continuous Integration for the world: Agile code + Agile Infrastructure	With all the interest in Continuous Integration and  Delivery, we believe that organizations can greatly benefit from an 'Agile Infrastructure': this would enable frequent changes to happen both at the application level and at the infrastructural level. This session wants to explain and *demo* how the concept of 'Infrastructure as code' can help. We envision the OS and middleware build a second pipeline parallel, integrated in the traditional build process. \\n\\nThe concepts can be visualized as shown in this graphic: http://www.jedi.be/pages/ci-for-the-world/ci-for-the-world.png	New Horizons & New Voices	Demonstration	2011
9033	Agile Hardware and Co-design	Agile software development is getting attention also in embedded software development. Embedded system development on the other hand requires  different engineering disciplines working together. When embedded software team starts using agile methods, it affects also other disciplines. Agile development emphasizes continuous learning through experimenting and collaboration instead of following a detailed up-front plan. Agile embedded software team expects different behavior in system co-design. This talk discusses reasons and ways to adapt agile development to co-design of system development.\\n	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Talk	2011
9038	Creating an Environment by Making, Keeping, and Amending Agreements	Software processes such as Scrum, XP, and Kanban are a set of practices that a team agrees to follow.  Making, keeping, and changing agreements is crucial to the success of any agile process.\\n\\nA team s agreements and their ability to make, keep, and renegotiate these agreements is fundamental to their success.  However, many times, team members are not all clear on their agreements.  They may not have the same understanding of the explicit agreements and are usually carrying around a set of implicit agreements that they expect their peers to execute.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011

9047	Agile Coaching Self-Assessment -- Where do you Stand on the Competencies?	As an agile coach, where do you stand? Where have you "got it down"? What more do you need to develop so that you can be the coach your teams truly need?  In this interactive workshop, thought-leaders in agile coaching Lyssa Adkins and Michael Spayd lead you through a self-assessment using an Agile Coaching Competency Model that covers both the *doing* and the *being* of agile coaching. You'll leave the session with a specific plan of action for improving your agile coaching and (likely) many insights about the nature and importance of agile coaching -- for yourself and for your teams. \\n\\n	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
9048	Introduction to Behavior Driven Development	BDD helps development teams hold conversations about the behaviour of their system with non-technical stakeholders. BDD has changed from its early roots as a replacement to TDD and now encompasses Feature Injection, extending across the whole software lifecycle. In this tutorial we look at the original reasons for BDD, returning the focus to the language and conversations at its heart. We look at how BDD s patterns can be applied at multiple scales, from the initial project vision all the way to the code, to deliberately discover and address ignorance in every aspect of software development.	Working with Customers	Tutorial	2011
9051	Managing dependencies to create value	The normal dogma of agile execution is to avoid dependencies as they are perceived to disrupt flow and the ability to act with agility. But, why avoid a dependency that creates business value such as reusing customer information across products? Why add yet another framework which would increase the technical debt when there is one suitable already there?\\n\\nThis workshop will provide and refine a framework and practices to identify and manage the dependencies that truly create value while avoiding those that don't. This will ensure a more constructive way of dealing with dependencies.	Enterprise Agile	Workshop	2011
9052	How CSlim and Fitnesse Can Help You Test Your Embedded System	Imagine pushing a button and knowing within minutes that your entire embedded system works to its specifications. With open source tools, you can build into your embedded system the means to write automated tests that will aid communication between team members, verify your code, and allow the specification of functionality before it is implemented. This tutorial takes you through everything you need to write Fitnesse and CSlim tests in your C or C++ based embedded system. We'll also cover the bigger picture of how and why these tests are valuable. Bring a laptop!\\n	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Tutorial	2011

9066	One earthquake, hundreds of volunteers and six days to build a website 	On February 27, 2010 Chile was struck by one of the most devastating earthquake. A team of of hundreds multidisciplinary professionals spontaneously arose to help people of our country. Although the abundance of talent, courage and determination, the team was not able to focus due to the stress, lack of information and chaos. We were called to coach this team and could experiment the power of agility in such an exceptional context. In only 6 days the team implemented a web portal and several other tools, helped by kanban, agile programming, holacracy and retrospectives.	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
9068	Agile Security:  They're Not Mutually Exclusive!	In the federal government, or in any industry where secure systems development is a concern, security requirements are typically considered at the end of development, right before transition into production.\\n    In this session, we will examine recent changes in security doctrine, and how these changes favor secure development and align well with agile methodologies.\\n    Based on work with the National Security Community over the last 3 years, the presenter will describe how to build security in throughout development, and how to put the emphasis on building a secure system.

9074	Continuous Integration: The minimum viable product	What does it mean to 'do' Continuous Integration? It used to be enough to execute your unit tests in CI.  But the bar is steadily raising for engineering practices. In the last decade we've seen tremendous improvements in acceptance testing. JavaScript is now a platform in it's own right. Cloud computing is now vital. There's growing interest in deployment to prod.\\n\\nSo Continuous Integration is under more pressure than ever.  As the bar slowly raises for engineering practices, we ll present 2011's minimum viable feature set for Continuous Integration.	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Talk	2011
9077	Democracy unleashed: bringing agility to citizen engagement	Empowered individuals. Creative, participatory decision making. Connectedness and care for each other. These words apply equally to an Agile organization as to a healthy community. What might happen if we applied Agile values and methods to transform communities? I will share my experiences over the past year and up to Agile 2011 to nurture engaged community in my home town - tools and methods, trials and triumphs, how Agile applied to community differs from organization. This is bleeding edge stuff, an area of opportunity for Agile consultants to do work that transforms the world.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
9082	Stories from my Experiences Learning Scrum	Stories of using Scrum as a distributed team to build a piece of software (Veracity) which helps distributed teams use Scrum.\\n\\nVeracity is an open source DVCS, somewhat like Git or Mercurial, except that it can manage record-and-field oriented data in the same "decentralized" manner as directory-and-file oriented data.  Its goal is to allow other kinds of team tools (such as agile planning) to be decentralized, not just version control.  Veracity includes a Scrum project module.\\n\\nNeither we nor Veracity are great at Scrum (yet!), but both are getting better with every iteration.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
9083	"It Depends on Context": You CAN get there from here, if you know where here is	Every Agile project must respond to organizational conditions and climate. Gaining awareness of context helps the core team and project community know how they fit into the larger organization. As a systems thinking approach, Agile Chartering and its focus on context enables better decision making, taking the whole system into account. In this session, we will share our experiences with chartering and demonstrate interactive tools and techniques for executive sponsors; portfolio, product, and project managers; and project teams to define and work with their specific project context. 	Business & Project Management	Demonstration	2011
9088	The Product Partnership: Using Structured Conversations to Deliver Value	A shared understanding of product needs is the basis for continual value delivery -- and requires a partnership of product stakeholders. In this tutorial attendees experience a technique that enables partners to collaboratively analyze needs and make just-in-time decisions on what to deliver next. The technique engages partners in structured conversions using seven question-sets to explore, evaluate, and decide on high-value options for the next cycle delivery. Attendees gain insights on how to use this technique to guide product need conversations at any level of agile product planning.   \\n	Working with Customers	Tutorial	2011
9089	Fear-Driven Impediments	In many cases fear is a reason for impediments of an agile team and can cause many effects: resistance to organizational change, procrastination of decisions, inability to surface the real issues in retrospectives. To successfully remove such impediments, the fears of all involved individuals must be understood. If fear is a reason to fail, it should be dealt with as fast as possible.\\n\\nExamples:  \\nI must not use TDD, my boss forbid it.  \\nI will be fired or removed from the team if I say  no .  \\nWe can t change this specific part of the organization because team X would get unhappy.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Workshop	2011
9091	Whatever the problem, community is the answer	"What are the issues and organizations in this world too important to fail?" asked Lyssa Adkins at Agile 2010. Imagine if the Agile community banded together to tackle complex problems like a smart energy grid or reforming education. Our collective skills, knowledge and passion uniquely position us to make a difference. Whatever the problem, community is the answer. Come meet like-minded travellers. We'll use the engaging World Café conversation format to re-discover our gifts, the kind of world we seek, think beyond the usual debates, with actionable steps to make shifts on a massive scale.	Open Jam	Workshop	2011
9095	Creating a Team Culture to Navigate Conflict	Anyone who has spent solid time with an Agile team can attest to this one thing: conflict happens.  With Agile, we seek excellence and we see that conflicts arise one after the other. Harmony and disharmony are both normal.  But how can teams turn conflict into something productive and maybe even inspirational?  Models and tools to do just that are the core of this workshop.  Participants will leave the session with new ways of thinking about conflict on their teams as well as tools they can use right away to help their teams (and themselves) navigate conflict.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Workshop	2011
9104	How Social Media in Agile Projects can drive innovation	According to Gartner Group: Companies that are trying to restrain their workforce Internet usages will be extinct within the next 5-10 years...\\n\\nChildren of today use Twitter, Facebook and much more as a normal part of their daily lives - It is their network and backbone! The social medias are to them, what email and phone was to us and our parents.\\n\\nWe call these children "Digital Natives"!\\n\\nHow do we overcome the need for exposure and social interaction - both regarding recruiting and keeping skilled people, BUT also in high regards how can we use social media in our agile projects?	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
9108	Business Rules Essentials for Quality Software	How and when do you elicit and specify business rules? Where do you look for business rule clues? How can you measure the value of business rules? What is the right level of business rule granularity for testing? When can you start testing business rules? Answering these questions is key to enable effective estimating, building and testing efforts. In this interactive session, you learn how a collaborative, cross-disciplinary approach to business rules provides just-enough, just-in-time detail to develop, test and deliver quality software.     	Testing & Quality Assurance	Tutorial	2011
9111	Facilitation & Communication in Agile Teams	While traditional projects expect most communication to take the forms of email and manager-led meetings, agile projects expect teams to self-organize, collaborate and participate in decision-making. But what is self-organization? How does it work? This 90-minute tutorial will focus on what it means to self-organize, how it occurs and how to help it along, and the hurdles that must be cleared in the process. See how the proper use of facilitation in agile meetings can be a key driver in the development of high-performing self-organizing teams. 	Agile Boot Camp	Tutorial	2011
9112	Everything I know about Leadership I learned from Russell Crowe	While the boss is the person you HAVE to follow, a leader is the person you WANT to follow.  But are leaders born or do they grown through the trials and tribulations of experience?  Who are the people you choose to follow and what are their leadership traits? \\n\\nIn this fun and interactive tutorial we will examine several familiar characters from popular films and discuss their effectiveness as leaders and how they use their own unique style to influence the people they lead. We will then discuss which styles are most effective when working with self-organizing, self-directing Agile teams.	Leadership	Tutorial	2011
9117	My Agile Suitcase	Imagine you are an agile consultant or coach. You are called by the inhabitants from waterfall island, who haven t heard about agility before and want to benefit from your advice. Which practices, principles and values would you pack in your agile suitcase for providing them guidance? What would you leave at home?\\nIn this session experienced agilists will deliver insights in their agile suitcases. Their short, concise and entertaining Pecha Kuchas may give you hints for your own suitcase. Afterwards you will work on your own agile suitcases. This may help you to travel lighter next time.	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
9128	Agile Requirements Exploration with Tester Collaboration	Incorporating the testing mindset improves customer exploration of product needs. At the same time, agile test planning and delivery benefits from involvement in agile requirements analysis.  In this experiential tutorial, participants examine a subset of agile analysis models in tandem with specifying acceptance criteria to verify and validate requirements. Participants experience how incorporating the tester mindset during requirements exploration accelerates test planning and specification, enhances product quality, and uncovers missing, conflicting, erroneous and unnecessary requirements.	Testing & Quality Assurance	Tutorial	2011
9140	Coaching Success: Getting People to Take Responsibility & Demonstrate Ownership	Examine, practice, and apply thinking tools and communication strategies adopted by coaches worldwide for teaching, coaching, and inspiring ownership behavior the essence of personal agility.\\n\\nCome learn to apply and teach the Responsibility Process, to handle objections, and to know just what to do when another believes they're owning it and you believe they aren t.\\n\\nDoing so inspires far greater ownership behavior. You add more value as your charges take ownership. They learn, correct, and improve more easily, directly, and quickly. It's the empirical process at the individual level.	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
9143	User Experience Teams Gone Agile	If an open collaborative space, short iterations, story-cards, and functional testing are good for software development, then why are software the developers the only ones who have to do it?  What would happen if user experience designers followed the same practices?  In this energetic hands-on tutorial you will explore practices that some user experience teams have adopted/adapted from agile developers.  The session will also share some success stories that demonstrate how these techniques resulted in greater project success.	New Horizons & New Voices	Tutorial	2011
9167	Negotiating Agile Contracts	Business managers and consultants alike are finding that their standard templates for corporate contracts do not support the Agile process.  Instead, these groups must work together to find a new way to define roles and responsibilities within an Agile framework.  This session will focus on practical considerations from both sides of the negotiation table those paying for the work and those providing it in developing these agreements. Session facilitators will help participants develop an Agile approach to writing contracts from requirements definition through project closure and auditing.	Working with Customers	Tutorial	2011
9170	Agile Transition in Trouble? Using the Kotter Change Model as a Diagnostic Tool	Agile transitions tend to imply organizational change. According to change expert John Kotter 70% of all major change efforts in organizations fail. Is it any wonder that so many agile transitions deliver only lukewarm results?\\n\\nThroughout the session, the speakers will use the lens of the 8 Step Kotter Change Model to share their experiences guiding four organizations through their agile transition.\\n\\nIn this session you will learn the 8 Step Kotter Change Model and see how it can be used to guide your agile transition.	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
9172	Visual Portfolio Management - Putting the "Big" in Big visible tracking	In this interactive workshop we will explore the use of a Portfolio Alignment Wall (PAW) to track progress, visualize dependancies and increase collaboration on large portfolios. Experience the process of populating and managing the PAW through a portfolio simulation. \\n\\nWe combine Scrum-Of-Scrums, visual management, value streams and a simple set of rules to balance simplicity and sufficiency.  Bob and Mike have used this technique to manage delivery across 17 agile and waterfall teams, 11 major feature streams with cross team dependencies. 	Enterprise Agile	Workshop	2011
9173	Solving the 1-10-100 problem: Extending Continuous Delivery to QA and Ops	In many medium and large organizations, friction between Agile application development (Dev), Quality Assurance (QA), and Operation (Ops) teams kills productivity.  We ll discuss how the typical continuous delivery loop fails to take into account the need for bi-directional communication with QA.  The growing role of Ops in the application lifecycle means it needs to be connected to the same continuous delivery loop and be linked directly into Agile planning processes.  How does extending the collaboration loop to Ops potentially flatten the exponential 1-10-100 cost curve into a linear one?	Testing & Quality Assurance	Talk	2011
9176	Twelve Steps to Agility	**You're trying to do Agile & it isn't really taking.** You are running into problems at various levels, from naysayers on teams all the way up to C-level execs. At your company, everything is a  top priority  & frequent interruptions are the norm. \\n\\nExplaining  who does what when  is complicated, & there is no clear answer on how to simplify that story. Most meetings you attend are a waste of time in your view. You know Agile is part of the solution, but the results so far are NOT good.\\n\\n**You ask yourself: What steps can we can take now that are quick, cheap & effective?**	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
9178	Lean Fundamentals: Understanding Flow Through Games	The Lean concept of flow is the underpinning of Agile methodologies including Scrum and Kanban.\\n\\nThrough a series of games and simulations, you will get to experience the inefficiency of multi-tasking, measure the benefit of smaller batch size and start thinking about how bottlenecks impact your system.\\n\\nBy the end, you will understand flow and how it relates to agile practices such as stories and iterations.\\n\\nCome and learn through play.\\n\\n(We will play the Name Game and the Penny Flow Game)	Agile Boot Camp	Tutorial	2011
9182	Tell Me Why -- "The Golden Circle" of Agile Transformation	Simon Sinek s "Golden Circle" resonates with Agile adoptions. Often, we start with  What  as the core for our plans. Or, we may try to start with  How .  Why  can be conspicuous by its absence. I fell into this  What  trap when I was first guiding teams in Agile transformations. I hadn't first asked "Why" though I did embrace Lean principles for "How". I jumped to What the practices were: 5 steps of what to do, roadblocks to expect, and benefits to reap. In this tutorial, we'll create our own Agile "Golden Circles" of "Why How What" for successful transformations.	Adoption & Transformation	Tutorial	2011
9185	Lean Procrastination - How to Identify the Last Responsible Moment	Procrastination is the psychological behavior to needlessly and counter-productively defer tasks. Lean thinking recommends deferring decisions to the last responsible moment and delivering just-in-time. One is a burden, the other a management theory, yet both are concerned with deferring.\\n\\nMeet the Shu-Ha-Ri model of Lean Procrastination which gets you rid of management if applied to work you fully enjoy and master.\\n\\nPlay with us the new LRM complexity game to explore how complexity effects and changes the last responsible moment and how Lean Procrastination enhances flexibility.	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
9186	Strategies for Agile Portfolio Management	Traditional portfolio management frequently uses principles that are at odds with agile thinking. For example, believing that people should be 100% utilized might lead to us to start many simultaneous projects leading to high levels of team-member multitasking. Managing a portfolio according to these principles all but guarantees a continuous stream of impediments that interfere with team-level agility and sub-optimizes delivered value. In this session I discuss strategies for aligning portfolio management with agile development to ensure a better end-to-end flow of value.	Business & Project Management	Tutorial	2011
9192	Collaboratively Chartering Success	How do you create the big picture for your projects or teams? If the big picture is missing, you are not alone but you are probably struggling. Collaborative chartering is a simple but powerful tool that bonds communities around "why they are building what they are building. Known to many project managers, but unknown to many agile teams, chartering builds the large context around product, community and a delivery cadence just to name a few. If you are looking to augment or replace kick off sessions, drop in and learn concretely how to get started in a valuable direction.	Business & Project Management	Workshop	2011
9197	Agile engineering practices and tools	Extreme Programming put strong emphasis on engineering practices to support agile execution and have in practice influenced how many of those practices have evolved. Scrum assumes such engineering practices are being used, without dictating specifically which practices. In this session, we will dive into the most important agile engineering practices and the kind of tools that supports them. We will also discuss the evolution of such tools, including those from both the open source community and commercial vendors.	Agile Boot Camp	Tutorial	2011
9207	Integrated Product Development	In this session, interaction designer Tim McCoy and agile coach and practitioner David Hussman introduce a new way of working. Integrated Product Development combines design skills with agile delivery. Drawing on their real world experience from a range of companies, David and Tim provide a cohesive and integrated process which iteratively draws out real value and context. You will learn goal driven design thinking that helps before and during iterative development. Stop in if you want to try tools that develop rich user experience during the iterative deliver better and timely products.	Hands-on Learning	Tutorial	2011
9210	Applying the Dreyfus Learning Model to Focus your Coaching Approach.	Acquiring any skill through instruction and experience (e.g. flying a plane, practicing yoga, or developing software using agile) involves progressing through common stages of learning. Understanding those stages, the behaviours people (and teams) exhibit at each stage, and how to effectively coach toward the next stage, is crucial for anyone tasked with assisting a team's agile transition. We will present the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition, its 5 common learning stages as applied to agile transition, and coaching advice for each stage based on their common observable behaviours.	Coaching & Mentoring	Talk	2011
9212	Scrum and Kanban Like Chocolate and Peanut Butter	As you adopt Scrum across your enterprise, you will find that synchronizing the work of interdependent Scrum teams is a challenge. Kanban has a number of principles and practices that can aid this synchronization and thus smooth out your adoption.\\n\\nThis session will introduce Kanban from a Scrum perspective, show how the Lean practice of  One Piece Flow  is the key to both, and get into the nuts and bolts of specific practices and concepts from Kanban that can be adopted by an existing multi-team Scrum program.\\n\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
9213	Release your team's intelligent energy through five powerful conversations	With successful agile teams there is a vibrant team buzz present. Struggling teams often seem dispirited and anemic. As a Scrum Master, coach or manager, you'll learn the five key drivers of engagement: I fit, I'm clear, I'm supported, I'm valued, I'm inspired.\\n\\nYou will work with others, focusing on these drivers, to build the five key conversations that will tap & release the latent intelligent energy of the people on your teams.\\n\\nYou will also be able to apply the techniques in this session to your family or other group situations. Prepare to be energized and challenged! 	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
9215	Applying Agile to IC Development... We're Not That Different After All!	Agile software development methods have been adapted to and applied in a number of other areas. ASIC/FPGA development, however, with its big bang development and delivery model is an area where agile is strangely absent. This talk examines how agile methods in the following areas may be used to gradually displace the big bang model:\\n\\n* feature based, incremental development\\n\\n* early/sustained collaboration between design, test, modeling and embedded software experts\\n\\n* regular retrospectives\\n\\nIncluded are ideas for how agile may best be introduced to hardware teams.	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Talk	2011
9219	Enterprise Agile Visioning and Learning   from the Organization to the Person	Truly Agile organizations require new ways of creating and sharing knowledge.  In this session, Jean shares personal experiences and exercises in visioning & learning models. Each model targets a particular part of knowledge creation. For the organizational level, we look at PDCA coupled with Pascal Dennis's True North & Mother Strategies. For team learning, we work with ORID retrospectives. Finally, Peter Senge's personal visioning helps us dig into our own work within an Agile growth-oriented context. This regular cadence of visioning and learning truly sustains Enterprise Agile.

9228	Distributed Scrum: Why some teams make it work well and others don't	How does a geographically-distributed team collaborate across distance, culture, and even language? What can an organization do to encourage successful teamwork? What technologies and practices increase collaboration?\\n\\nThis workshop will explore the patterns that enable companies to successfully deliver software with a distributed team. It will be co-presented by the VP Technology of a company that adopted Agile for teams in three time zones with two languages and cultures, and an Agile coach that assisted with the transition.\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Workshop	2011
9231	Agile Isn't Enough	Agile isn't the destination, it isn't even everything you need to get there, at best it's a set of ideas that will help you find what you need along the way.   At this session, we'll explore other sources for some of the things you'll need.  \\n\\nWe'll look at a sampling of techniques, tools, and ideas from outside of agile that are extremely useful to agile teams :\\n\\n* Current Reality Tree - from Theory of Constraints\\n* Paper Prototyping - from IxD\\n* A/B Testing - from Lean Startup\\n* What's the next action? - from GTD\\n	New Horizons & New Voices	Workshop	2011
9238	To Deliver Faster, Build it in Reverse	Agile enables building a system in any order. To get business value faster, it may be better to deliver in the REVERSE order. Corporate waterfall starts with the foundation and the pipes, but on a large-scale Gap e-commerce program, we're flipping the approach:\\nStarting with the fulfillment of orders,  then the customer facing web site, from there to the content and data feeds and last to the tools and foundation.\\nIn the talk we'll discuss:\\n\\nAttributes of Agile that enable this approach\\n\\nBenefits / Disadvantages / Risks\\n\\nThe architecture requirements to support this reversed delivery\\n	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011

9265	Routine Conflict Processing as a Cultural Norm	Regardless of the Agile techniques you employ, one thing is for sure: lots and lots of conflict is being generated. Questions about the current best idea, authority distribution,  identifying impediments, and impediment removal are just some of the sources of conflict and heat in Agile adoptions. \\n\\nConflict can kill your best intentions for your teams and organizations. Protocols- "structured interactions"-- are a useful tool for processing mistakes, differences and conflict. Attend this session to learn how to develop enterprise-wide norms for routinely processing conflict.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011
9269	Handling Product Management Across the Enterprise	The common model of a product owner works well for small to medium scale Agile adoption. However, for large scale Agile adoption one must expand the role to include a product manager that works with the business stakeholders while the product owner focuses on driving the teams. How proper product portfolio management that eases the handling of business dependencies by properly loading the backlogs of the teams involved is presented. The timeliness of this flow from business stakeholders to product managers to product owners to teams also demonstrates the need to keep backlogs to a minimum.	Enterprise Agile	Tutorial	2011
9271	Innovation Jams: Lessons in Agile Product Development - An Experience Report	Shortening time-to-market requirements have put software developers at product companies in a crunch. Many organizations need to cut their development time in half, yet the team is already working in overdrive. This talk reflects the experience of Accept Corporation in developing products in 3-4 day sprints dubbed  innovation jams . We ll share how we can make a set of new product features in under a week, using online customer submissions to guide development priorities and a process flow that accelerates collaboration so we can focus on coding.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
9314	Narrative Coaching	People problems - some we expect and have answers for, sometimes only ideas. Sometimes we just don t know. The narrative approach helps you collaboratively identify and draw out the solutions people have inside themselves.\\n\\nNarrative is a social or personal problem solving approach that shifts power and truth to the person wanting help. It strengthens areas of success. It is not prescriptive. It does not assume the coach has all the answers and needs only to talk with the client enough to identify the problem and prescribe a solution.	New Horizons & New Voices	Clinic	2011
9316	Planting the Power of Strengths-Based Teams	Why do you love or hate what you do? What difference does it make in productivity for your team? I'll share highlights from my experience with several groups, and Dan will share how the teams at Technicolor use it, as well as a quick how-to on ramping up teams on a strengths-based approach. We'll also cover several common strengths in IT and coaches, and how I've applied the test results to help team members find the niche on the team that plays to their strengths and brings out their best.

9328	Facilitation Fun: BE the challenge you face!	Facilitation skills are essential for anyone. In fact, everyone facilitates whether they know it or not! Do you work on a team, manage an organization, or otherwise work with others? The opportunity to facilitate will come up.\\n\\nSteven  Doc  List leads you to explore the common patterns & antipatterns that come up in facilitation, for the facilitator and the participants. We ll have fun by taking on roles, and exploring the behaviors that work and that don t work. The session will include some time on specific activities and techniques that can be used for effective facilitation.	Open Jam	Tutorial	2011
9347	Integrating UX Into Agile: How To Ensure Your Sprints Result In Usable Software	Learn about the UXI Matrix, a modified version of the product backlog that integrates UX-related information to help the team consider UX impact when working the backlog. It helps you track user experience work and its impact. This is not a product. It s a simple set of techniques proven in multiple projects, that allow you to improve your ability to deliver great experiences to your customers in an Agile fashion. See the next generation in the evolution of the product backlog and find out how to overcome the weaknesses of traditional product backlogs that don t consider UX related work.

9454	Evolving to Agile: A story of agile adoption at a small SaaS company	There are many sources of information about agile adoption in an enterprise environment.  However, I have not found similar material focusing on the challenges present at smaller companies.  This is the story of agile adoption at a small, organic growth, enterprise SaaS software company.  We will discuss what problems we were experiencing before adopting agile, what problems we experienced during adoption, and what problems we are still experiencing.  During the story we will also touch on what we did to address these problems, both successfully and unsuccessfully.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
9504	Vertical Slicing: Smaller is Better	Do your teams have trouble breaking down stories so that they always have demonstrable functionality at the end of a 2 or 3 week sprint?.  Enter "vertical slicing,"  the exercise of breaking a story down into smaller pieces that when completed individually, still offer demonstrable business value.   There is much mention of the concept of vertical slicing in literature, but there few published details on how to actually do it.  In this session, you will learn how we created a model for successful vertically sliced business value, and helped our teams toward hyper-productivity.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
9544	Moving development and testing out of their Proterozoic silos	For far too long development and testing have lived in silos, serving different masters. In most organizations, testing is the neglected child. 'Anyone can test' - and organizations hire accordingly.\\n\\nThe main message behind this session is how to handle testing organizationally and realize not only the skills needed for a successful testing organization but also how the interaction between development, product, and testing needs to evolve.\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Workshop	2011
9574	The Origins of Agile	What is Agile Development, and how did it come about?  How was software done before agile, and why did we change?  In this talk we will trace the recent history of software processes starting with the grand misinterpretation that led to Waterfall and culminating with the revolution that led to the Agile Manifesto.  We'll talk about what software development was like before Agile, and what makes Agile so different. 	Agile Boot Camp	Talk	2011
9604	Agile in Academics	Our university bastardised Agile tools to give curriculum designers in an academic setting increased productivity and improved motivation. This allowed the designers to provide better quality and cutting edge courses in less time. The online educational team implemented and shared a personal kanban, dropped job descriptions, and saw massive improvements throughout. Scrum was then studied, dissected, and reassembled for our needs. Writers are now asking regularly to write for us, while designers have more free time for adding new dimensions to the curriculum in addition to normal expectations.

9615	Agile Thinking for Business Analysis   Going beyond user stories	The agile literature currently largely overlooks many of the existing tools and techniques of analysis, often with a focus on user stories as the primary tool for defining and presenting requirements in agile projects.  \\nThis workshop presents a variety of analysis techniques which can be used to identify and elaborate customer needs, to compliment the use of user stories and ensure that the right customer needs are effectively presented to the team at the right time in a way that ensures the right product gets built.  	Working with Customers	Tutorial	2011
9655	The Transformation Priority Premise	Transformations are like refactorings in that they are simple incremental changes to code.  They are unlike refactorings in that they change the behavior of code.  This talk presents a set of transformations sufficient to create any application.  It also suggests that when they are applied in a certain order developers can avoid many of the common problems with TDD such as painting yourself into a corner, or taking steps that are too large.  It also suggests that the ordering helps developers to find better algorithms.

9925	Agile From the Top Down: Executives Practicing Agile	Organizations will have trouble sustaining a true Agile culture if the Sr. Management team does not live the same way.  IT Executives must practice what they preach. If they want teams to be transparent and agile, they need to practice themselves and lead by example. \\n\\nThis talk will share some Agile & Lean techniques, applied in a new way, to help organizations understand their constraints so they can transparently carry forward their journey to becoming Agile. \\n\\nYou can view the slides for my talk at jonstahl.com. I would upload a PDF of the slides but the file size is too large.\\n	Leadership	Talk	2011
9964	Agile Education by Object Game   most HISSATSU way to understand it.	Some people cannot understand  agile technique such as TDD and refactoring because these practices need "Object-Oriented" manner. This method can change non-OO brain into Object Oriented brain for only 4 hours by very easy way!  Learner can understand Why OO?  OO Application Behavior, OO Applications Architecture.\\n\\nIn Japan, Many people have gotten Object Oriented brain since 2006 by this method. and Join Agile Teams! even CEO can understand OO Application  behavior. AMAZING! In this hands-on, you can understand and experience that methods to make OO Brain!\\nSee: http://slidesha.re/ogo5mJ\\n	Hands-on Learning	Clinic	2011
10005	Making Metaphors that Matter	In this paper and talk we'll present our experiences with using architecture metaphors, how they helped us, and some tips we learned for making great metaphors that improve team communication and architectural discussions. Our experience grew out of the IVET project, a collection of software tools to help shoppers of a regional grocery store chain plan menus, find recipes, create shopping lists, and clip e-coupons.  The team built a set of web services in addition to a web client and iPhone app.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
10030	The Agile Scaling Model (ASM): Be as Agile as You Need to Be	The Agile Scaling Model (ASM) provides the context and advice for effectively tailoring agile strategies.  It describes how to extend the agile construction life cycle into a full-fledged disciplined agile delivery life cycle from project initiation to production.  It then describes how to tailor agile practices to address eight scaling factors: team size, geographical distribution, domain complexity, organizational distribution, regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, technical complexity, and enterprise disciplines (such as enterprise architecture, reuse, and governance).

10113	Beyond Planning Poker - The Planning Poker Party	People across the world keep discovering Planning Poker. It's a helpful technique, but Planning Poker is not the only game in town.  By itself, it's not the right game when confronted with a large batch of un-estimated stories.  In this session we'll review Planning Poker and some of the underlying principles, and some other uses of them. Then we'll scale the ideas of planning poker and affinity grouping to handle large batches of stories in The Planning Poker Party. We'll walk through the steps needed to get a large backlog sized, and an initial release plan in place.	Working with Customers	Talk	2011
10150	Test-Driven Development in(bed) C	Test-Driven Development is for Java programmers, not for C!  Yes it is!  Roll up your sleeves and test-drive C with us.  We'll start with a short intro to TDD, and quickly get you doing TDD.  Bring your laptop.  If you don't have one,  we'll team you up with another programmer.  You'll see how to make TDD practical for embedded software development.  See <a href="http://cpputest.org/node/42">CppUTest Compilation Environment(http://cpputest.org/node/42)</a> for needed tools. We'll also have a bootable Linux DVD with all the tools so that you can join the experience.\\n	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Workshop	2011
10201	How to design stuff that matters fast	Too much time is wasted creating that big design upfront only to find that users don't like what you have built once it has been released. Today we are in danger of not only over designing, but also designing solutions to the wrong problems. \\n\\nSee how I experiment with rapid design techniques to ensure design solutions for the **right business problems** are delivered to the **right target audiences** *rapidly* and *continuously*. Learn how to create design solutions fast as a team and work with a client to get products that really matter out into market early that will delight users.\\n\\n	User Experience & Interaction Design	Workshop	2011
10202	Cracking the Agile Big Rocks	Agile solves many problems with software, but presents a new set of challenges for management - the big rocks.  For example, personnel evaluation, agile in a waterfall business, agile and PMO, poor emergent design and more.\\n\\nThis is a highly interactive session.  Before the session, conference participants can post thier big rocks.  During the session the facilitator will present expert opinions on solving those problems.  Participants will form teams and pick their hot issues,  develop potential solutions by medling experience and expert opinions, and present thier solutions to the group.\\n	Enterprise Agile	Workshop	2011
10580	How Functional Programming Changes Developer Practices	Functional programming (FP) is going mainstream. First seen as a better approach for concurrency, we are finding that FP has pervasive benefits, often supplanting OOP for many purposes. This talk explores how FP aligns with, but also changes developer principles and practices.\\n\\n1. FP emphasizes mathematical rigor and rich types, which change TDD.\\n2. Capturing your domain model in code has serious drawbacks.\\n3. *Pure* functions and immutable data structures are more modular and reusable than objects.\\n4. FP introduces new "design patterns".\\n5. *But*, FP can be hard to master.	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Talk	2011
10596	Exploratory Testing in an Agile Context	Exploratory Testing (ET) isn't new; the term was coined before "Agile." But ET and Agile fit together hand-in-glove. The disciplined Agile engineering practices like TDD and CI mean the code is constantly checked against expectations. But does it also do things we don't expect? Are there lurking risks and surprises? That's what ET can help us discover. And that's why stories aren't really Done until they're both checked and explored. This session explains ET in the context of Agile and gives participants an opportunity to try it out by exploring a hand held electronic game.	Testing & Quality Assurance	Clinic	2011
10636	Leadership Agility in a VUCA World 	Participants will apply leadership agility tools throughout this presentation that combine the leadership agility research and experience of an **Organizational Psychologist, Dr. Nick Horney** with **AGILE Expert, Jim Highsmith**.  Dr. Horney will share his 20+ years in the application of leadership agility with senior leaders from multiple industry sectors and global locations.  Jim Highsmith will provide the commentary and perspective from the AGILE community, reflecting his recommendations about combining the learning from AGILE methods with insights from strategic leadership agility.  	Leadership	Talk	2011
10686	Embedded Storycrafting: Key to controlling Risk and Schedule	In embedded development, much infrastructure must be built before the first user feature can be delivered. Customer-value stories will often be too big. But breaking them down risks losing the focus on delivering functionality. The answer? Let your evolving user stories be the catalyst that drives hardware-software co-development in the early iterations, and then draws in each related engineering discipline as naturally as an acorn develops into an oak tree. Many examples from real embedded teams will be given, and sessions will be offered in open space to practice the technique hands-on.	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Talk	2011
10782	Acceptance testing in the land of the startup 	Songkick is a web based music startup which operates in a new market place full of unknowns, developing a free service. Focusing on user experience as one of the most critical features of the product. Continuously iterating and experimenting with features based on user observations and metrics. Unusually we adopted Acceptance tests and BDD while still in the early startup phase. Having spent more than 2 years growing our system and learning the pain points both technically and culturally we have lots of interesting lessons we would like to share about startups and Acceptance testing.

10877	Kaizen Lego Game	After revolutionizing the automobile industry, Lean principles have been applied to different knowledge areas, such as software development. However, many people are using this ideas without having been introduced to the concepts that made Lean successful.\\n\\nIn this interactive session the participants will work in a small Lego production line, trying to improve their own process using different kaizen techniques. Up to 30 participants divided in small teams will learn about Kaizen, PDCA, standardized work, 5 Whys, Genchi Gembutsu, A3 reporting value stream mapping in a hands-on experience.	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
10905	Agile Clojure	This session is a hand-on immersion into an agile development project using Clojure.  If you're new to Clojure, not a problem.  The nature of the project will educate you in the language as well as a toolkit for agile development.  If you're new to Agile, perfect!  You'll experience all the facets of an agile project possible in a half-day session.  If you're experienced in Agile and/or Clojure, awesome! \\n\\nWe'll work in micro-iterations, with customers, stories, acceptance tests, pair programming, etc...  It's sure to be a fun filled adventure that'll get you waist deep in Clojure action.	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Tutorial	2011
10908	Tests as a Means of Abstraction	The different nature of functional languages can lead to a different perspective on test-driven design: 1) that the soul of the program is a network of relationships among facts-about-functions, 2) that tests are a usefully more abstract way of describing that network than is the program itself, and 3) that data structures should not be designed because they are better viewed as an epiphenomenon--froth thrown off by the network as it computes.\\n\\nIn this session, we'll show these claims in action and question them. The example will be in Clojure, but knowledge of Clojure is not required.	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Talk	2011
10914	Experimentation: a Missing Agile Practice	Your initial Agile transition had great results. However, now you find the process has problems of its own. It doesn't fit your company, team, or domain perfectly. There's no advice for what to change. Now what?\\n\\nYou already know a safe, effective, and constructive way to explore an unknown domain: do explicit experiments.\\n\\nI will show how to identify the problem and contributing factors, develop and perform a set of experiments to see what might work better, and then follow through on any process changes that you deem fit. We will take on one or two problems from the audience as examples.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
10915	Code Sense	Does reading code make us better?  Can we recognize good code when we see it?  Do developers agree on on what good code looks like?\\n\\nIn this session we'll try to answer these questions.  Together we'll take a momentary glance at dozens of code snippets and secretly decide if we like them or not.  Then, tempers will flare and fireworks will fly when we compare notes with each other.  There are endless lessons that you will learn and your foundational beliefs about code will be challenged as we develop our code sense.	Open Jam	Workshop	2011
10918	Simple Methods for Reliable User Involvement	One of the difficult problems faced by an Agile team is that of getting reliable user input. Since Agile projects depend on minimal up-front planning and specification, user feedback is critical. But product owners are rarely users themselves and the actual end-users are often located elsewhere and may be highly diverse. This session introduces participants to Contextual Inquiry (CI), a proven field research method for understanding users and their needs. We introduce CI, show how it fits into Agile development, and give participants practice in gathering data and then writing user stories.\\n	Working with Customers	Tutorial	2011
10932	Agile and Kanban In Coordination	A review of the results of running two teams side by side inside the same development organization one traditional Agile iterative development the other Kanban.  Both teams are fully coordinated with each other in a simple and effective system that optimizes responsiveness without compromising quality.  I will detail my experience taking a 30 person development team from a rudimentary agile implementation to a fully Agile organization running both Agile / Iterative and Lean / Kanban models of development side by side.

10951	Courageous Curiosity: Agile from the Inside Out	Agile isn't just another methodology. 'Becoming agile' isn't about learning a set of tools. The _process_ is the easy part. Here, we'll tackle the hard part: putting love at the center of how you work.\\n\\nThe values of the Agile Manifesto & Extreme Programming encourage us to practice courageous curiosity, changing how we move in the world. In this workshop, we'll explore technologies--technique--for working compassionately.	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
10957	Writing Maintainable Automated Acceptance Tests	Test automation is software development. As with other software development efforts, most of the cost of test automation occurs during maintenance after the tests are first written. Automated tests can become brittle, so that a small change in a requirement or in the software renders scores of tests obsolete in the blink of an eye. How can we reduce the high cost of inevitable change? Dale Emery demonstrates key principles for writing adaptable automated tests: remove duplication, focus on the essence of the test, and name every important test idea.	Testing & Quality Assurance	Demonstration	2011
10959	Stages of Practice: the Agile Tech Tree	There are many stages of practice for each practice. These are the details that get lost in most discussions. What does it mean to practice Continuous Integration, TDD, or Pairing? If you use a CI server, are you doing CI?\\n\\nThat depends.\\n\\nThe Civiliation games have a "Tech Tree" that show the hundreds of technologies available. They are broken into branches (sea exploration, flight, etc), with dependencies between the branches. We will build a similar tech tree for agile practices, showing how the agile practices interleave and how they change as you develop each branch further.	Adoption & Transformation	Workshop	2011
11028	Breaking the Rules to Increase Customer Satisfaction	This is a story of on-going improvement in both process and culture.  With queue times upwards of 120 days, customers were becoming more upset and the divide between support and engineering seemed to be growing.  Nearly twice as many defect reports were being created than were able to be fixed with a few dedicated pairs.  In four months we have cut our lead time in half, established greater predicibility, and have continued to gain back the trust of our support organization.

11031	Enter the Bubblesphere:  You and Your Agile Project Portfolio	Bubble charts, seriously?  Yes!  Even the best agile development teams may have yet to mind meld with a professional product portfolio manager, and vice versa.  This simulation gives product managers some new agile bubbles to use when charting their portfolio performance, and provides developers with new tools for collaborating with business owners.  All attendees will focus on how to maximize long- and short-term ROI for IT portfolios, along with learning to evaluate per-iteration team value delivery.\\n\\nThe simulation was be fine-tuned at Agile Games 2011 in Cambridge, MA.

11037	Teaching Kids Programming with Agile Techniques 	In this workshop, attendees will experience our Intentional Method of introducing children (ages 10+)\\n to programming using recipes (lessons at  www.TeachingKidsProgramming.org ).  We use Agile techniques such as pair programming, randoris, short iterations, re-factoring & test-driven development in teaching.  Pair instructors model Agile practices while teaching. \\nLearn how to teach technical processes using Agile techniques.  \\n\\nAlthough we ve mostly used our method with children, we have also successfully taught adults using similar methodologies.<img src="http://bit.ly/gSTsDY"/>  \\n  	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
11055	Complexity at Cisco Voice Technology	In this article we'll tell our story of changing a waterfall culture into an iterative and incremental delivery system. We will talk about the principles of the agile software development life cycle we created, and the steps we had to take to embed this new process into the organization. We have managed portfolios and product teams, this article will tell you how we did it, and how we won't do it again. We have trained teams, project managers, product managers and saw how training an exec team can fail and cause disastrous results. \\n	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
11062	Resistance as a Resource	When people resist change, change agents both new and experienced can become confused, stuck, and frustrated. Dale Emery describes how you can turn resistance into a resource. Whatever else it may be, resistance is information information about the values and beliefs of the people you are asking to change, about the organization, about the changes you propose, and about yourself as an agent of change. In this session, you will learn and create ways to tap into that information to translate resistance into effective action to move forward with change.	Coaching & Mentoring	Talk	2011
11074	What We Have Learned So Far: what we got right & what we got wrong	Many of the established ideas and practices of Agile had their first public exposure through Ron and Chet.  They helped take Agile from an underground movement to the mainstream.\\n\\nIn this talk, Ron and Chet will bring you up-to-date on their current thinking on how to best do software \\nin the Agile style.  They will explain why you should stop doing some of the things they recommended in \\nthe past and what to replace them with.  They will take one more run at getting you to do some of the \\nbasics of success that many teams neglect.\\n	Coaching & Mentoring	Talk	2011
11103	When the VP is a Scrum Master, You Hit the Ground Running	In early 2010, the new VP of Unisys Cloud Engineering was chartered with implementing agile methods in a department of engineers with decades of waterfall successes.  He was also an experienced Scrum Master.  One year later, we had completed over 200 sprints for 20 products across four geographies.  I ll tell the story of how we implemented Scrum, what we learned, and what we would have done differently.  	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
11104	Applying the lean startup model to the Enterprise	Much is wrong with the way enterprises model the delivery of software projects, starting with the fact they use the project model. What if enterprises treated the software delivery lifecycle based on the concept of products instead of projects? A useful model exists for this paradigm - Eric Ries' lean startup movement.\\n\\nJez will discuss applying lean startups to the enterprise, using examples such as Amazon. He'll also demonstrate how oft-sited blockers to such a model (and to the DevOps vision) such as SOX, ITIL and COBIT, can in fact be made compatible with this model.	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
11105	Continuous Delivery	This talk will focus on the engineering practices required to achieve the goal of agile development: satisfying the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. I'll cover the importance of good configuration management, automated testing at all levels, and continuous integration.\\n\\nThere will be a particular focus on why feature branching is considered harmful, and alternative techniques which allow for continuous deployment while developing functioanlity incrementally such as branch by abstraction, feature bits, and dark launching.	Open Jam	Talk	2011
11108	The empirical process - at the very core of Agile	Agile is all about empirical processes, controlled by feedback loops. But what does it mean?\\n\\nMost agile practices and principles are rooted in control theory. Knowing these concepts will improve the skills of any coach or mentor. In this  popular science -session, software development will be described as a (simplified) mathematical process. It will teach how feedback, sensors, noise and delays affect outcome, error, robustness and other properties of our process.\\n\\nBoth people with 10+ years of agile experience and absolute beginners are likely to get something out of this session.\\n	Coaching & Mentoring	Tutorial	2011
11110	Scrum in Sales	In the fall of 2010 the iSense sales and account management teams adopted Scrum for their sales processes. In this presentation, one of the sales managers will share his experiences by presenting the processes, lessons learned and main achievements, of using Scrum in sales. The most stringent effect of using Scrum in sales was the insight that the direct cause and effect for closing a sales deal, can be detected and as such controlled.

11121	CREATING  CUSTOMER  DELIGHT	The failure of traditional management has led to the reinvention of management: the whole organization must be focused on creating a stream of additional value to customers through continuous innovation. The reinvention reflects an application of Agile thinking to the whole organization.\\n\\nWith the growing power of customers, it is no longer enough to *satisfy* customers with early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Now customers must be *delighted*. In effect, the bar has been raised. The workshop will show how this more strenuous objective can be attained: http://bit.ly/ihcVL2 	Working with Customers	Workshop	2011
11122	MAKING THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AGILE 	The failure of traditional management has led to the reinvention of management: the whole organization must be focused on creating a stream of additional value to customers through continuous innovation. The reinvention reflects an application of Agile thinking to the whole organization. \\n\\nThe session shows how applying Agile thinking to the whole firm involves five fundamental shifts in terms of the firm's goal, the role of managers, the way work is coordinated, the shift from value to values and the shift in communications shift from command to conversation: http://bit.ly/bryJHX	Leadership	Workshop	2011
11136	Experiments: how does team structure affect behavior?	When several teams work within the same codebase they share a lot responsibilities. For example, all teams are equally responsible for keeping the build green. However, teams are also committed to sprint goals that are independent from each other. So what happens when the build breaks and the sprint is nearing its end? Let's experiment how structure affects behavior and try to find structures that enhance responsibility.

11137	Three Months from Idea to Implementation: Jumpstarting Agile in Nuclear Power	We had 3 months to plan the production for 80 control systems intended for a Westinghouse nuclear power plant simulator.  We were on the critical path and our delivery dates were quickly approaching.  A chance introduction to agile principles offered a beam of light.  Within 3 months we held our first Sprint planning meeting, and, in 3 months, we delivered our first software release on-time. It was a significant team achievement that combined Scrum with complex embedded systems development.  Join us to learn what we did and what we learned from our mistakes.  \\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
11140	The Fundamental Agile Apologetic	A talk based on the "big four" series by Jeff Langr and Tim Ottinger (from Pragmatic Bookshelf: http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2011/02/big-four.html ), this session tells us why the fundamental concepts of software design virtually require us to adopt agile practices.  The fourth in the series shows how software volatility further motivates automated testing, pair programming, continuous testing, continuous integration and constant attention to code quality.	Open Jam	Talk	2011
11141	How a Traditional Project Leader Transitions to Scrum	Transitioning from a traditional project manager to Scrum is challenging. The PMI Project Manager manages the project by ensuring that intermediate deliverables are delivered at various stages of the project. Agile development emphasizes the need for producing tangible results as soon as possible and as often as possible. The resulting role of an Agile project manager is fundamentally different from a PMI Project Manager. We will map the PMI responsibilities to Scrum and show a project manager how to more easily make the transition to an agile practice.	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
11142	To Make a Long Story Short: Splitting User Stories	Large stories mix different levels of functionality, risk, and value. Large stories are disproportionately hard for teams to understand, estimate, and implement. There _is_ a way out: split stories to a manageable size, while keeping them valuable to customers. \\n\\nWe'll examine splitting and merging stories using a variety of concrete techniques. We'll see why splitting on technical lines sounds easy, but gives poor results. Finally, we'll practice applying splitting techniques. You will leave with a toolkit of 20 or more ways to split stories, directly applicable to your project.	Hands-on Learning	Tutorial	2011
11144	Applying Agile to the Operations of a Training Organization	ThoughtWorks Studios Workshops group has decided to  eat its own dog food  by running its training group using Agile practices.   This session will discuss the challenges of a training organization and how we successfully applied Agile practices to our operations.  Our training organization has two distinct tracks of work:  1) creating and managing our content and 2) managing training engagements.  Each track has its challenges, but we have found a way to apply Agile practices to both tracks of work.\\n	Business & Project Management	Talk	2011
11146	Seeing and Steering Systems:  Three Pragmatic Tools	When managers get out of the day to day work and focus on leading and improving the organization, they need a different set of tools.  These tools aren t new; but, they haven t been widely taught in management training programs. These tools help leaders at all levels move beyond "telling & selling," and provide a way to influence patterns of behavior, understand causes and effects, and generate options for action..\\n\\nIn this session, I ll cover three pragmatic tools:  Eoyang CDE, Expand the Problem Horizon, and Finding Factors.\\n	Leadership	Tutorial	2011
11147	Team Traps	Some teams soar; others wallow, bicker and slog their way to uncertain results.  Teams that soar have a few things in common: they have a shared goal, interdependent work, complimentary skills, mutual accountability.  Slogging teams have a few things in common, too.  They fall into predictable traps.  What are those traps and how can you help your team climb out of them?  That s what Esther is here to talk about.\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
11152	The Vision Thing: How Do _You_ Charter?	User stories describe features - _how_ a system will work - and may even describe value or purpose ("in order to..."). But stories are not the starting point: there's a deeper reason and deeper context for projects, often framed as some sort of _charter_. Charters (by whatever name) define projects' vision and mission, measures of success, boundaries.\\n\\nHow do you handle the chartering aspects of _your_ projects? Come to this peer-to-peer workshop, prepared to share what you do, and prepared to learn from others.  We'll work in small groups, then share results with the larger group. 	Open Jam	Workshop	2011
11165	A Transformation Path to Enterprise Agility: Change Levers, Leaders & Culture	Organizational transformation is a journey, not a destination. It requires discipline, patience & courage, leaders at every level, insight on culture, a stomach for change. It requires real teams & the will to endure for years.\\n\\nIn a fishbowl style consultation, one organization (will you volunteer?) will provide a realistic context to explore models of leadership, team dynamics, culture & change: the framework for deep, ongoing enterprise transformation. Meanwhile, participants organized into table teams will craft their own transformation plan, using a template & feedback from colleagues.	Adoption & Transformation	Tutorial	2011
11166	Agile and Kanban Work Together to Deliver Maintenance Releases	Agile and Kanban together to create maintenance releases separates the unpredictable job of fixing defects from the predictable work to validate them. Defect resolution times are hard to forecast because the environment may be hard to recreate and a safe fix may take analysis. Very short Agile sprints manage the constant prioritization of defects and team coordination. Defect validation time is more predictable and Kanban provides a reliable way to verify small batches of fixes for a maintenance release. Come learn how to use these processes together to improve your maintenance deliveries.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Demonstration	2011
11176	Leading Continuous Improvement in Established Agile Organizations	Many organizations believe they have successfully completed the transition to agile thinking. They follow a standardized "agile" process by rote, and they boast of horrifying process smells, like "We never miss a commitment!" Lost in the flurry of self-congratulation: The notion of continuous improvement. Lean thinking brings new models and analytical tools to the table. In this session we examine conventional agile practices through a lean lens to discover opportunties for improvement (mura, muda, muri) that are hiding within the canonical ceremonies of first-generation agile practice. 	Leadership	Talk	2011
11210	Overcoming Self-organization Blocks	We know that self-organization is a critical aspect of every successful Agile project and we know that it takes trust, respect, openness and responsibility; so why many teams have a hard time to achieve it? Self-organization changes the manager/team dynamics and the teammate/teammate ones. Resistance may arise and the source is frequently rooted in mental habits, such as  a latent blaming culture, confusing guidance and command, fear of taking responsibility or losing status, unconscious agendas. Attend this session to learn, through demos and exercises, how to deal with these kind of issues.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
11212	Geek Leadership in Deep Legacy	The overwhelming majority of development is legacy work, and much of that is deep: 4 years or more. Geek leaders in legacy need reliable techniques for helping teammates develop skills and attitudes to tame the legacy Cthulhu.\\n\\nHere are five proven techniques geek leaders can use to slay the beast: __Tight-Focus Refactoring__, __Lottery Learning__, __Noob Spinning__, __Pressure Bottlenecking__, and __Blind Baby Stepping__.\\n\\nAs a technical leader in a legacy setting, you get to charm your team toward agile practice. Here are some tricks to bring with you.\\n	Leadership	Tutorial	2011
11215	Enterprise Scrum at Belgacom	Belgacom (Euronext: BELG), the largest telecommunications company in Belgium, is transitioning to Agile with sponsorship from senior management. In this session we will give a recount of the fronts that have been successfully tackled so far: Running pilot projects, building an Enterprise Scrum transition team, combining waterfall with Agile, distributed Agile, financial governance, fix-priced projects and RFPs (agile contracts), PMO, project governance, training, technical practices, busting silo thinking within operations, and Agile with large packages such as Siebel, PeopleSoft and SAP.	Enterprise Agile	Talk	2011
11219	Agile Adoption in a non-Western cultural context: Is it any different?	The Agile Manifesto s values and principles need to be applied differently in different cultural contexts. Raya Software made the decision to transform its practices to those of agile software development in early 2008. As an Egyptian company, it was faced with challenges specific to Egypt s cultural context.\\n\\nThis session aims to share adoption insights with non-US companies that want to embark on the journey towards becoming an agile organization, describing a mental model to plan for such a transformation. It also has relevance for US-based companies working with offshore partners.\\n	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
11254	Zero to Agile in 3 to 5 years - It's a Marathon, not a Sprint	Transforming mid-to-large-sized organizations requires much more than an introduction of agile principles and practices to teams.  Any agile introduction is the start of a cultural, structural, political, and personal transformation, and to be successful requires understanding, commitment  to focus on all of these dimensions...and...time.\\n\\nStories abound about large companies starting agile transformations and resulting in reversion to the old ways, or some other state of "hybrid" agility.  This talk is about an effort to change a large company holistically.	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
11266	Architecture and Design Evolution	How do we evolve the architecture and design of a product iteratively and incrementally in Agile? Without a complete and robust architecture and design upfront, would the product not run significant risks? These are some of the questions that challenge a team that is new to Agile. In this talk, we shall learn the practices and principles of agile architecture and design.\\n\\nWith examples taken from real projects, the talk will illustrate how incremental architecture and design decisions are built into a product across iterations, through stories where they are required.	Agile Boot Camp	Talk	2011
11270	Anatomy and Physiology of an Agile Transition	Starting as a coach of a team with almost no agile experience and an release pending was quite daunting. Change was slow and at first it seemed like we might not succeed in converting the team and delivering the product. It took patience, support at many different levels of the organization, and hard work from many different people to put this team on the path to becoming a functional and productive agile team. Now the team is growing as a successful and productive agile team. I am proud to have been a part of going from mostly offshore waterfall development to a local agile development team.

11272	Undoing Performance Review Damage - Coaching towards Customer Purpose	The Performance Review survives almost intact in most organizations despite the ever increasing rate of adoption of agile and lean techniques. Unfortunately attempts at motivating and engaging employees from such a mindset is more likely to cause damage. Help your coaching clients to understand the pain of the Mass Production mindset with an experiential simulation. And then see within the simulation how coaching can help adjust the process to use intrinsic motivation through more deep understanding of customer purpose.	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
11304	Building Great Teams	In coaching, I generally find teams assembled with some thought to colocation and skills. At best they ve been through agile training, picked a team name, and created team norms. Then it s time to get to work.\\n\\nThese steps can produce high performing teams. More often they produce average performance. \\n\\nRather than hope for greatness, helping teams form can ensure team members become equipped to deal with identity, trust, and task issues thereby generating agreement and commitment between the team members.\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011
11305	Making Hard Choices about Technical Debt	The technical debt metaphor acknowledges that teams sometimes accept compromises to meet an urgent demand. Although unmanaged debt can have disastrous results, strategically managed debt can help businesses take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities. During this session,we will play the Hard Choices game. In your quest to release a quality product, you must decide in the face of uncertainty whether to take shortcuts and incur penalties, or to traverse more of the board to potentially earn more value. At the end, we ll compare strategies and share practices to help make these choices.	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
11309	What Makes Agile Great and How Can We Get More Of It?	As a successful practitioner of Agile, you are interested in the events that created our fantastic community. You have success stories to share. You are interested in future improvements. Come share your unique successes and help shape the future of agile.\\n\\nImagine it is the year 2022. What happened in 2011 that created the second, golden decade of agile? What monumental successes have we had since 2011?\\n\\nIn this workshop, inspired by the events at Snowbird in 2001 and 2011, you will create a manifesto or a call to action that will inspire our future community. \\n\\n	Hands-on Learning	Workshop	2011
11321	Growing Embedded Applications Organically with Ceedling and Friends	Our group of scientists have formulated a suite of open-source tools that make growing robust C applications an enjoyable endeavor. These tools facilitate organic growth of robust and maintainable applications. Unity, Ceedling, CMock and CException are open-source projects whose aim is to make setting up and growing embedded C applications a trivial effort so that developers can focus on features and content. A full overview of these tools will be given, followed by a demonstration of how these tools are used collaboratively to facilitate an efficient TDD workflow in C.	Agile for Embedded Systems Development	Demonstration	2011
11326	There is No Spoon: When Agile Becomes One with the World of Work	When we look at the Agile Manifesto we talk about people, interactions, collaboration and responding to change.  However, we fail by only relating it to software and customers.  It is time we started to embrace entire organizations being agile.  Even then it requires entire communities, systems and society to collaborate towards a common purpose.  When we move in that direction there is no agile only evolution.	New Horizons & New Voices	Talk	2011
11327	Getting beyond 'good enough' - a user goal based framework for Agile Delivery	Agile delivery typically focuses on the prioritisation and development of atomic user stories. Often the focus is on developer throughput and misses the overall value proposition of the software from the perspective of the end user. This session will introduce a user goal based framework for setting up and managing Agile projects for success. It will introduce an approach to Goal Driven Development that will allow stakeholders/Product Owners to take a user centered approach to delivery from requirements capture, through planning and into development to deliver software that delights the user.	User Experience & Interaction Design	Talk	2011
11343	The PO Role - Can you hear me now?	Transition from the PM & BA role to the PO role can be challenging but rewarding. In our organization, the PO role has tremulously evolved and we have made it a role that does not have very specific boundaries. The PO role has empowered and enabled traditional PM & BA to take ownership and be decision makers.  When they speak teams and sponsors listen.  However, with great power, comes great  responsibility.  In this session, I will highlight how the PO role has evolved in our organization and some lessons learned of the role .\\n	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
11344	Managers vs. Agile Teams: Who Makes the Decisions?	Agile teams face daily decisions in a dynamic environment. Participants in this workshop will learn key strategic & tactical decisions agile teams make, including how they draw on experience to drive decisions. This is an interactive session that reviews how decision quality is assessed, how decision quality metrics are implemented and how metrics can be improved on their teams. Participants will rate their own levels of decision quality around particular agile activities. Participants should have some experience working on agile teams,e.g. as scrum master, product owner, tester, developer.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Workshop	2011
11350	Get to CMMI ML3 Using Agile Development Processes For Large Projects	This session will discuss how VSTI, a SAS Company, obtained their CMMI Maturity Level 3 rating while doing agile development processes for large projects (over 30 developers). This will cover automation of documentation and best practices for obtaining a rating of CMMI ML 3 with a large development project, while adopting Agile and Scrum processes. Agenda:\\n\\n1) The major points where Agile and CMMI seem to conflict \\n2) How to get past this conflict and still be productive by: \\n   a) Using proper tools to help save time \\n   b) Automating documentation \\n   c) Daily scrums are critical!

11352	Increasing Learning in an Agile Environment: Lessons Learned in an Agile Team	Learning and agile are highly related. In the last 3 years, the knowledge of the team increased in all aspects: technically and socially. Everyone in the team, from interns to more experienced programmers, ended up as high-skilled programmers, using (and understanding) all recommended best practices. In this report we will present some techniques we used to enhance learning in our work environment, such as Book Club, Brown Bags, Dojo sessions, Pair Programming, Open Spaces, etc.	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
11369	Next Generation Model-Driven Development for Agile Projects	An overview of model-driven development and the new concept of "continuous model transformation" within the context of agile projects accompanied by real-world examples based on an open source MDD toolkit.  A discussion of how using MDD and Agile together results in higher quality results though continual shortening of the development-feedback loop and template-based evolutionary architecture methods. How to use MDD to generate automated tests to jump-start test development. This talk will present a case study of two successful projects that demonstrate the MDD-Agile value proposition.	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Talk	2011
11370	Cultural Architecture	If our business culture was a product, how would we re-architect it? Culture influences everything. So how can we influence culture? What tools help us understand cultural influences, from the implicit, the elements we don't even think about, to the visible, the artifacts that lead to stereotypes? Adopting an Agile culture, when it is under-laid with the cultures of the world is challenging. Reconciling cultural dilemmas drives collaboration and innovation. Culture is the core of it all. Knowing this, you can create a pull for cultural change in your organization.\\n\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
11376	Why Can t We All Just Get Along? Improving Designer/Developer Collaboration	The relationship between designers and developers is often portrayed as adversarial but it doesn t have to be that way! User experience (UX) professionals and engineers have a golden opportunity to work closely throughout the entire Agile development cycle to build better products. In this session Agile team members will identify breakdowns in their own teams  collaboration and learn practical solutions that help designers and developers work more efficiently and more happily. Through interactive exercises attendees will share their own experiences and learn from other practitioners.  	User Experience & Interaction Design	Talk	2011
11379	The Only Agile Tools You'll Ever Need	Do you need a high-end agile project management tool to support your growing agile adoption? Or do you need a high-end tool because your adoption has strayed from agile values?\\n\\nLow-tech tools such as information radiators and index cards can provide great results, but how do you use them most effectively? What's the sweet spot for high-end tools, and how do you prevent them from sapping productivity? What tools are missing from the spectrum of software-based tools? \\n\\nDisclaimer: This is *not* a vendor pitch, and the speaker owns no stock in companies that produce index cards. :-)	Adoption & Transformation	Tutorial	2011
11382	Agile Office Spaces - Enabling Collaboration and Agility	Your Agile team has the right processes, engineering practices, tools, people, and technology, but what about your office space? Sure, you have a prominently displayed Scrum board, but does your physical environment enhance your collective Agility? \\n\\nDrawing from experiences at Agile shops and government offices, and in collaboration with his wife (Conni Gutierrez Cheng, a professional interior designer specializing in collaborative office spaces), Richard Cheng will lead a workshop session to bring together experiences of the attendees to create a shared learned experience.\\n\\n\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
11391	Will Pair Programming Ruin Your Team?	A lightning talk based on the article at :\\nhttp://agileotter.blogspot.com/2011/01/pairing-competence-and-recognition.html\\n\\n	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
11393	Acceptance Test Design Principles	Are you designing your agile acceptance tests (ATs) well? I've derived (with the help of Tim Ottinger) and used a list of seven principles to vet the quality of ATs. I've found these principles very useful in helping agile teams improve their tests. Good ATs are:\\n\\n* Abstract\\n* Bona fide\\n* Cohesive\\n* Decoupled\\n* Expressive\\n* Free of duplication\\n* Green\\n\\nYou'll see ATs (based on real agile team examples) that show violation of the principles and subsequently improved tests that adhere to the principles. One minute per principle, and one minute to wrap up!	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Tutorial	2011
11431	Beyond Metrics	NOTE: There is a size limit for 2MB for presentations, so tweet either @adhondt or @ravindar to get the full slide deck.\\n\\nMetrics should only be used to measure progress until a specific goal is reached, after which we no longer track it. Instead, we learn to focus on more holistic goals and intangible indicators that keep a team humming along smoothly. Team energy, communication patterns, slack and reflection are much more important to increasing productivity than any myopic set of metrics.	Adoption & Transformation	Tutorial	2011
11432	Definition of Ready	Definition of Ready is a set of agreements that lets everyone know when something is ready to begin, e.g., when a user story is ready to be taken into a sprint, or when all necessary conditions are right for a team to start a sprint. Definition of Ready does not attempt to turn a user story into a specification, but instead creates an interesting social agreement between the various stakeholders involved in delivering a product or system. 	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
11436	The Story of the Wall	Do agile teams really still use index cards, PostIt notes and walls for planning and managing projects? Yes, absolutely. Even in this age of sophisticated tool support it is hard to beat the raw power and efficiency of working with physical media and using walls to display information. Using photos, videos and music, this talk describes the experiences of several teams from the perspective of the walls in the room. From architecture, requirements, planning, and sizing, to tracking project progress, see how teams use paper, markers and walls to foster collaboration, innovation and teamwork. 	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
11440	From 'Team' to 'Wow team': an agile team's journey	Our department had been practicing Agile for three years. In the first two years, we learnt how to be really good. Then we began to plateau...complacency crept in, we drifted away from the spirit of agile and began to skip the basics. In this talk we describe we overcame this. How we went from being a team on the slide to a "wow team" by seeing every problem as an opportunity, converting small thoughts into great ideas and finding innovative solutions for problems.\\n\\nDo you want to know the simple yet powerful basics that can make a huge impact and make your team a Wow Agile Team?	Insights - Experience Reports	Experience report	2011
11447	Refactoring in the 4th Dimension	Time is the 4th dimension. We don't pay enough attention to it. We \\nmake assumptions about how changes occur in our code based upon static analysis \\nand tools like the Open/Closed Principle, but we can make our decisions \\nbased on actual data: we have version control histories of our code.\\n\\nIn this workshop, we will mine several projects and look for \\nearly indicators of souring code and evidence of effective refactoring.  We will \\nexplore the notion that we can learn from the history of our own code.\\n\\nParticipants should bring a laptop with git and Ruby 1.8.7 or higher installed	Development Languages Practices & Techniques	Workshop	2011
11449	10 Minutes to a Better Standup	OK, you know the standup is supposed to last 15 minutes, but yours' last 45 minutes or more.  You wonder, how can we say anything useful in 15 minutes? \\n\\nIn this 10 minute lighting session, which by the way is shorter than your standup, we will use a sample Team Board (I did say Team Board, not Task Board) to demonstrate how to hold an effective standup that will allow your team to quickly coordinate, and thus self manage their efforts.\\n\\nWe will also learn more about the Almost Daily Sit Down, and learn how sit downs, can be the cure for your sick standups!\\n	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Demonstration	2011
11452	Scaling and Failing - The Human Limits of Effective Software Development	In this lightning talk, Michael Feathers will make the argument that most Agile adoption problems are fundamentally scaling problems. He will then relate two case studies which point toward the sort of advantage we might gain if we thoroughly embrace the limits of scale rather than trying to finesse them away.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
11455	Enterprise Coaching - Practical Lessons Learned	Coaching in the enterprise requires creative initiatives and appreciation of the long view of organizational change. This discussion reveals the story of one company's ongoing agile adoption from a coaching perspective and invites participation from attendees to add to the conversation, ask questions and challenge ideas. I intend to provide several practical concepts for other coaches and attendees from large organizations to take back with them to try in their own context.	Coaching & Mentoring	Talk	2011
11473	Building an Agile Culture in a Regulated Environment	Omnyx, a GE Healthcare venture, has implemented scrum ground up, intentionally shaping the organization, cadence, and office space and focusing strongly on culture, core values, and team building activities. Writing a new Quality System allowed bridging the traditional divide between agile and regulated environments. Using a continuous Alpha/Beta process, we effectively incorporated stakeholder feedback while still working on our initial product launch for 2+ years. We firmly believe that culture is the most underestimated aspect of agile and it needs to be #1 priority for any agile leader.	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Talk	2011
11479	Slackers and Debtors: Meet Commitments, Reduce Debt, and Improve Performance	Does your team have trouble finishing its stories every iteration? Is your "done done" actually a "maybe maybe?" Are you constantly removing stories from your plan? If so, this session will help. We take a close look at the relationship between technical debt, velocity, and iteration slack. We teach you how to use slack to achieve a stable iteration velocity, increase team performance, and get your stories "done done" every time.	Hands-on Learning	Tutorial	2011
11482	Raconteur: luring programmers into testing and testers into coding	Raconteur is an acceptance test framework inspired by Fitnesse and Cucumber. Its goal is to help shorten the developer-tester gap. It lures programmers into writing ATs in the comfort of their IDE and favorite xUnit. The testers get to share the same tool, enjoying intellisense and refactorings, while keeping the test syntax that they are used to.\\n\\nThis session will demonstrate the main capabilities of the tool from the perspective of what is innovative in the approach. Fundamentally, we will provide a glimpse at how IDE integration blurs the boundaries between testing and coding.\\n\\n\\n	Testing & Quality Assurance	Talk	2011
11493	Faster Usability Testing in an Agile World	The sheer speed of an Agile project can be frightening to even the most experienced UX practitioner. In this session you will learn how usability testing can be conducted very quickly, without sacrificing quality. We will cover strategies and techniques that can be used for speeding up traditional usability testing, on-site, remote and Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE) methods. We will cover usability testing from planning through analysis, and ways to provide useful and usable recommendations to the team. 	User Experience & Interaction Design	Tutorial	2011
11494	10 Minutes to Testable Specifications	Come to one of Agile 2011's fastest paced workshop and learn the basics of creating testable specifications that drive requirements clarity, engender collaboration, increase estimation accuracy, and cure many of the ills that plague agile projects today.  \\n\\nWe won't make you an expert, but our acceptance criteria for this session is that you will leave with an understanding of how testable specifications improve your requirements and how the approach varies from the Test Drive Development that developers do.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Workshop	2011
11502	Bad-Assed Double-Loop Learning: From Judgmental to Good Judgement	"We all know" Agile leaders foster self-organization, so why do many have little effect on their teams, or worse, actually harm their effectiveness?\\n\\nPeople act in ways that are rational to them, but differences in mental models can make people seem irrational. By uncovering your team s mental models, you can help them achieve a common rationale. This leads to stronger, integrated teams.\\n\\nScrumMasters, Coaches, Managers, & Team Members will participate in robust scenarios based on team simulation in aviation and healthcare. You will leave experience directly applicable in your workplace.	Coaching & Mentoring	Workshop	2011
11517	Agile and the 21st Century Corporation	**The new economic and social century** is pressing on organizations from every side. What conditions will make demands and how will we adapt? Will Agile provide a long term delivery capability and business solution in the face of a frantic economic reality? Will our competitive nature give us the freedom to build partnerships, even with those outside of our organizations who have heretofore been our enemies? Can we build a creative ecosystem that will last beyond fads and overcome fear of change? Join us for a dialog & workshops on preparing to meet these challenges in our own organizations.	Business & Project Management	Workshop	2011
11536	Telling Better Stories with User Story Mapping	User story maps help us understand the product we're building, break in down into small pieces to build iteratively and incrementally, and effectively plan minimal viable product releases in holistic product slices.  In this quick tutorial participants will learn the basics of user story mapping by building their own story map quickly and collaboratively.  They'll see examples and hear stories of a wide variety companies who've used story maps to simplify backlog building, planning, and delivery.\\n	Working with Customers	Tutorial	2011
11537	Agile Methods Influencing Non-IT Projects	One software development team has found that its agile team practices have been emulated by several of its clients and admirers for non-software projects.  Learn how practices such as short iterations, daily standup, storycards, early releases, and pairing have been adopted in organizations for projects that might surprise you.  These organizations include a law office, manufacturing plant reconfiguration, architecture, industrial lighting, and book publishing.	Business & Project Management	Talk	2011
12633	Making team flow and progress business readable	The last two years we adopted BDD/ATDD, including automated acceptance criteria validation while preserving their business readability (using specification-by-example). \\nAs a side effect of this practice, progress became more transparent:instead of just seeing remaining work and stories done, we track individual ACs showing progress in a business readable form.  This helps testing and early feedback.\\nThe talk shows how automated AC validation increased transparency in our project and briefly walks through our AC refinement flow, how we monitored progress and merged into living documentation.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
12637	Agile won't work here... really?	In this session, the presenters will share their experiences implementing Agile in what many people believe to be incompatible environments. In the first half of this session, Candi Rai will discuss how they adopted Agile in their mainframe COBOL environments in order to save $500,000 in costs while simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction. In the second half of this session, Marc-Ellan Begin will discuss how the European Space Agency (ESA) is adopting Scrum with industrial contractors in a fixed-price contracts context, replacing their traditional waterfall processes.	Adoption & Transformation	Talk	2011
12639	Refactor Your Wetware	You are used to working with software and hardware, but what about working with wetware your own brain? Do you know the best ways to learn, or to think about solving problems? In this one workshop we ll journey through bits of cognitive science, neuroscience, learning and behavioral theory.\\nYou ll see surprising aspects of how brains work and see how to beat the system, improving your own learning and thinking skills.\\n	Collaboration Culture & Teams	Tutorial	2011
12642	Climbing and Governing the Enterprise Agile Mountain	   It s too risky for our financial institution customers; No requirements - no way!, Regulatory auditors will eat us alive ,&   2 Years Later:  these concerns & more were solved to move to Enterprise Agile.  With a strong vision, a worker-derived roadmap, heavy change management lifting, and internal agile coaches, we did it.  What did those look like?  How were  hearts & minds  won?  What teams, tools, training, & rewards, drove the change through?\\n	Enterprise Agile	Talk	2011
12643	New Ideas and Emerging Results workshop	The workshop will provide an excellent opportunity to present and discuss opinions, ideas and suggestions for future research. We aim to bridge the gap between research and practice through presentation of position papers, alongside partners from the agile practitioner community.\\nSix position papers will add to the body of knowledge on agile methods and processes, agile teams and people, and the tools and practices that support them. Presentations of position papers with first authors: Mark Mahoney, Morgan C. Benton, Celio Santana, Yaser Ghanam, Renan de Melo Oliveira and Bill Curtis.	Research at Work	Workshop	2011
12644	Research Methods Workshop	To produce research results of importance it is crucial to apply the right research method. This workshop focuses on the challenges of applying research methods to study agile software development. Authors of accepted full papers in studies of agile software development are invited to give a short presentation of their research method, and there will be discussions on how to apply case studies, experiments, surveys and literature reviews. This workshop is intended for researchers.	Research at Work	Workshop	2011
12646	The home ground of Automated Acceptance Testing: Mature use of FitNesse	The concept of automated acceptance testing (AAT) has had nearly a decade to mature. While it has their score of supporters, it has not been embraced as a silver bullet for software development. The problem is that knowledge of when and where to fruitfully apply such a tool and method is scarce. In this article we describe a project group where the developers by their own account successfully use FitNesse. By describing how they select the appropriate places to use FitNesse, and how they use it, other practitioners can apply this to their domain. This corresponds and adds to recent research.\\n	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12647	Reconciling Perspectives: How People Manage the Process of Software Development	Social factors are the significant cost driver for software development and in this field study we develop a grounded theory of how people manage the process of software development. We discovered the main concern of those involved in the process of software development is getting the job done and to get the job done, people engage in a constant process of Reconciling Perspectives.  What this theory reveals is the importance of individuals  ability to reach out and engage in negotiations to the success of a software project.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12648	Collaborative Events and Artefacts in Agile Teams with Interaction Designers	We studied 4 agile teams including interaction designers, since the integration of interaction designers on agile teams is an open issue. We found some designer-developer collaborations were for planning, but most were for enacting plans.  These latter collaborations took three forms:  scheduled, impromptu and chats. Regardless of the form, all designer-developer collaborations were mediated by twelve categories of artefacts.  These helped to determine, more precisely what to create.   We discuss implications of our observations for theory and practice. 	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12649	User-Centered Design and Agile Methods: A Systematic Review	This paper presents the results of a systematic review of existing literature on the integration of agile software development with user-centered design approaches. Through systematic and rigorous research methods and data analysis, this paper shows that a common process model underlies such approaches and discusses which artifacts are used to support the collaboration between designers and developers.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12650	There's Something About Lean: A Case Study	An idea gaining significant interest at the moment is  how can we apply lean manufacturing principles to software development?  There is however, limited information on how Lean is being used by industry practitioners and if the principles and practices are as effective as current interest levels suggest it might be. We have used a case study to explore the practicalities of how one high-performing, open source team, has adopted Lean practices. We found that the existing\\nmeritocratic culture of the team under study appears to have greatly assisted the team s adoption of Lean principles.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12652	An Agile approach to optimising our digital strategy	 Today, the most popular way people prefer to make contact with organizations is online as customers embrace new digital channels. We needed to modernize our digital presence to take the conversation to the channels where those conversations are taking place. Utilizing an Agile approach allowed us to increase site usability and responsiveness to consumer needs.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
12653	Understanding Post-Adoptive Agile Usage   an Exploratory Cross-Case analysis 	The widespread adoption of agile methodologies raises the question of their continued and effective usage in organizations. An agile usage model consisting of innovation, sociological, technological, team, and organizational factors is used to inform an analysis of post-adoptive usage of agile practices in two major organizations. Analysis of the two case studies found that a methodology champion and top management support were the most important factors influencing continued usage. Both horizontal and vertical usage was found to have significant impact on the effectiveness of agile usage. 	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12655	The Combination of Agile and Lean in Software Development 	Recently there has been a noticeable focus shift from agile methods such as XP and Scrum to lean, indicated as  from agile to lean . However, the reality may not be as linear as the term implies. To better understand the combined use of both, the experience reports published in the past agile conferences were examined. The study shows that the two can be combined in different manners for different purposes. Lean is often applied as guiding principles for agile development. When combined at the practice level, flow-based lean processes tend to substitute time-boxed agile processes.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12656	IEEE Best Paper - Decision Making in Agile Development: A Focus Group Study	Abstract This research defines decisions made across four periods of the sprint cycle based on input from a focus group conducted with 43 people on agile teams. Results indicate that Sprint Planning includes decisions about planning work for the subsequent sprint, Sprint Execution includes tactical implementation and development decisions, Sprint Review includes decisions about continuing future sprints based on customer product satisfaction, and Sprint Retrospective includes decisions for improving the sprint process. Six key decision making obstacles were also identified.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12657	Enacted Routines in Agile and Waterfall Processes	Agile methods form an alternative to waterfall methodologies. Little is known about activity composition, the proportion of varying activities in agile processes and the extent to which the proportions of activities differ from  waterfall  processes. In the current study, we examine the variation in performative routines in one large agile and traditional lifecycle project using an event sequencing method. Our analysis shows that the enactment of waterfall and agile routines differ significantly suggesting that agile process is composed of fewer activities which are repeated iteratively.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12659	Survey of Agile Tool Usage and Needs	The usage of and satisfaction with tools supporting Agile methods has been and remains an unexplored area. Most existing tool surveys have been subjectively conducted by tool vendors, clearly focusing on company structure and a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. In this paper, we report on a vendor-independent survey on tool usage covering 121 responses from 35 countries. Our results show that the most and least satisfactory tool aspects are ease of use and lack of integration with other systems, respectively. We report on desired tool features and received comments.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12661	Rule-Based Exploratory Testing of Graphical User Interfaces	This paper introduces rule-based exploratory testing, an approach to GUI testing that combines aspects of manual exploratory testing with rule-based test automation. This approach uses short, automated rules to increase the bug-detection capability of recorded exploratory test sessions. A preliminary evaluation found that this approach can be used to detect both general and application-specific bugs, but that rules for general bugs are easier to transfer between applications. Also, despite the advantages of keyword-based testing, it interferes with the transfer of rules between applications.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12662	Agile Team Perceptions of Productivity Factors	In this paper, we investigate agile team perceptions of factors impacting their productivity. We here conducted two case studies\\nin the industry and analyzed data from two projects that we followed for six months. From the perspective of agile team members, the three most perceived factors impacting on their productivity were appropriate team composition and allocation, external dependencies, and staff turnover. Pair programming and collocation were the main agile practices impacting productivity. Finally, most team members did not share the same understanding of the concept of productivity.	Research at Work	Talk	2011
12665	Why Scrum works	Scrum seems to work extremely well as an agile project management approach. An obvious question is why. To answer that question, we carried out a longitudinal case study of a distributed project using Scrum across Denmark and India. In our analysis of case study data we used three selected theoretical frameworks. We conclude that Scrum works so well because it provides communication, social integration, control, and coordination mechanisms that are especially useful for distributed and agile project management.

12666	How to Save Your Industry $1.9B using Agile Methods	My Industry was faced with Legislation to reduce Govt Rebates to the Health Industry by $1.9B. As the key lobby group, we embarked on a digital strategy to support the campaign. We adopted an Agile approach in order to have a skinny website and mobile app up and running as soon as possible. Weekly sprint planning allowed us to build iterative changes into the release strategy in order to respond to stakeholders and the political debate. Kanban was utilised to prioritize widgets we required on the website and ensure our campaign remained responsive to stakeholders.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
12692	Why Care about Positive Emotions?	Dr. Barbara Fredrickson and her colleagues have found that positive emotions literally change the way the human brain works, widening people's perspectives, and their outlooks on life. According to Fredrickson s broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, this shift in mindset drives people to discover and build new traits, skills, and resources, and over time become better versions of themselves. In this presentation, Dr. Fredrickson will describe the science that backs up these claims and and describe the nonconscious upward spiral processes that enable people to thrive with agility.	Keynote	Talk	2011
12693	Code	Code is the stuff of software. It is the definition of the software. It is the enabler of functionality, the realizer of business value, the expression of understanding. It is also an expression of misunderstanding, a resister of change, a source of sunk costs.\\n\\nBut the word code has meanings beyond source and binary. In a broader sense, code and codes are also the stuff of software development. There are cultures of programming, principles of practice, manifestos of desire. Code refers to a set of conventions by which a group of people will govern themselves.\\n\\n	Keynote	Talk	2011
12694	 The Power of an Agile Mindset	I've wondered for some time whether much of Agile's success was the result of the placebo effect, that is, good things happened because we believed they would. The placebo effect is a startling reminder of the power our minds have over our perceived reality. Now cognitive scientists tell us that this is only a small part of what our minds can do.\\n\\nResearch has identified what I like to call "an agile mindset," an attitude that equates failure and problems with opportunities for learning, a belief that we can all improve over time, that our abilities are not fixed but evolve with effort.

12711	The Three Ingredients of a GREAT Product Owner	One of the most important components of successfully applying an Agile approach is ensuring that the right product owner is identified.  This attempt to find the right business representative has proven to be challenging in most organizations because they are uncertain about what they should be looking for.  This short session will review the 3 most important ingredients you should consider when seeking to fill the role of product owner.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011
12712	When User Stories Just Don't Fit in a Short Sprint	In a complex environment, it can be impossible to write user-valued, end-to-end user stories that fit in a short sprint. In this talk, we'll understand the potential waste of trying to make stories _too_ small. I'll explain ways for teams to keep the value and fast feedback of short sprints without sacrificing the goal of having end-to-end user stories. Hint: you may have to set aside some of your Scrum dogma.	Agile Show & Tell - Lightning Talks	Talk	2011

12718	Does Agile Focus on Value Delivery	Lean process has an exceptional focus on providing value to the customer. I ve often seen when groups are considering an agile transformation they are focusing on faster iterations, but faster iterations of what? An agile team can certainly deliver faster iterations of what the customer doesn t want. This lightning talk shows simple methods to ensure that Agile teams are focusing on value delivery along with speed. I will show how the user story/acceptance process can also focus on customer value. We will focus on Kanban and Kaizen as methods to utilize in the Agile value stream.

12719	Are Agilists the Bonobos of Software Development?	The chimpanzees and the bonobos are the animals whose genetic make-up is closest to that of human beings, but their “cultures” (and, yes, animals definitely do have well-defined cultures) are very different.  The chimpanzees are aggressive, and operate in a strict alpha male-dominated hierarchy, while the bonobos are gentle and promiscuous!  What sort of tie-in could this have for those of us who favor agile development over plan-driven?	Main	Talk	2006
12720	Overview of Agile	In this talk Hubert Smits provides a broad introduction to concepts of agile software development and agile methods. The talk is based on his experience as an agile coach and Certified Scrum Master. Traditional concepts from waterfall or plan-driven development are transformed to an agile perspective. Examples are release and iteration planning, progress reporting, meeting formats and scaling projects from 10 people teams to 300 people teams. 	Beginners	Tutorial	2006
12721	Agile Practices I	This session will contain four presentations which cover key aspects of agile development: planning and tracking, writing and telling user stories, testing, and project management. Each presenter will speak for 45 minutes, providing introductions, examples, and experiences helping communities employ agile techniques. All the presenters have published on the topics, and they are currently helping project communities of all sizes and shapes transition to agile. This session will be beneficial to people new to agile, or using agile and those looking for more guidance or insight from working professionals. 	Beginners	Tutorial	2006
12722	Is Agile Software Development Still Agile?: A fishbowl discussion to decode the mixed messages in the Agile Manifesto and our observations about Agile Development 5 years later	Agile Software Development has now been around for five years. The term Agile along with the Agile Manifesto united processes such as XP, Scrum, Crystal, Adaptive, and FDD under a common name and mostly common cause. But after the shine starts to dull on our freshly discovered common cause, one has to take a closer look back at the Agile Manifesto as it relates to what we've actually been doing over the past five years. If Individuals and Interactions are valued over Process and tools, why is it we have so many books and conference tutorials about process along with so many neat tools to support those well documented processes? The irony doesn't stop there. You'll find Agile books on documenting better user stories, tutorials on writing better customer contracts, and expert guidance on increasing the rate and efficiency of our planning activities. Oddly, we seem to be doing all out innovation on the right side of the Agile Manifesto statements - presumably the side we value less. Are we becoming the process dependent junkies we originally feared? These questions and more will be discussed and argued as we look back at Agile development over the past 5 years and ask "Is Agile Development still Agile?"	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12723	Agile Web Development	Agile web development using “standard” frameworks – such as .NET or J2EE – is difficult, mainly because the environments have test-averse constraints such as runtime code generation.  Over the past two to three years, a series of lightweight technologies have radically changed the landscape in the Java world. This session is a fully hands-on guided opportunity to test-drive real software changes using both unit and acceptance level tests working with these frameworks. The specific technologies to be used include Java, Spring, Hibernate, Velocity and FitNesse. People attending this session are highly recommended to also attend Test-Driven J2EE: Life Outside the Container with J.B. Rainsberger for a more in-depth understanding of the principles and techniques involved.	Hands-on	Workshop	2006
12724	Agile Software Development: The Current State of the Union	In March 2006, Scott ran an online survey via Software Development and Dr. Dobb’s Journal, two magazines which were recently combined into the new Dr. Dobb’s Journal.  The survey explored whether organizations were adopting agile methods and techniques, which ones they were adopting, and how successful they were in doing so.  Over 4,200 people responded to the survey, representing a range of organization sizes as well as various positions within those organizations.  This talk will share the results of this survey.

12726	Agile Software Development in the Large	A lot of people still believe that agile software development is for small teams only. However, the agile value system and the principles behind as stated in the agile manifesto don't say anything about team or project size. Furthermore the projects I'm working on are typically large, distributed and mission-critical. Therefore, several years ago I took the challenge and tried agile software development in the large. Meanwhile I made the similar experience on many large projects: Also large and even distributed teams can benefit from a value system that is beneficial for small teams. In this tutorial I want to show how to scale agile processes to teams of 200. In fact, the same techniques are also relevant to teams of ten or more developers, especially within large organizations.

12727	Intro to the Agile Manifesto	The agile manifesto was created to succinctly capture the common aspects of agile development. The presenters in this session will each spend 20 minutes talking about one of the four items from the agile manifesto: 1) Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, 2) Working software over comprehensive documentation, 3) Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and 4) Responding to change over following a plan. Along with being key players in the agile community, several of the presenters we among the group that crafted the original manifesto.	Beginners	Tutorial	2006
12728	Exploratory Testing is Really Agile Testing	Traditional lore in the agile world holds that testing is essentially a process of confirmation, asserting the product works properly and that it can be refactored with greatly reduced risk. Yet to be effective, testing must also be a process of investigation - asking challenging questions about the product, and answering them by operating and observing the product. Exploratory testing is a simultaneous process of designing tests, executing them, and learning is key to serving this part of the testing mission. There are many misconceptions about exploratory testing - that it is sloppy, random, unaccountable, or unstructured. (Interestingly, agile processes are sometimes accused of the same things.) This tutorial explains exploratory testing, shows its structure and discipline that may not be apparent to the untrained eye, and engages participants in exercises that give a feel for the process and some experience with it. Since it involves rapid learning, adaptation to new information, and lowered documentation overhead, participants should recognize that exploratory testing is a truly agile process, and should leave the presentation knowing how to do it better. Exploratory testing exemplifies the agile preferences for working software over comprehensive documentation, and for responding to change over following a plan.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12729	Making movies and software at the speed of thought!	Director Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids, El Mariachi, Sin City) is an Agile Director. He enjoys making highly creative movies quickly and cheaply. His ambition is to make movies "at the speed of thought". To achieve this goal, he works in small teams to develop the ideas, visualize them quickly, shoot the movie fast, and build the movie in layers. This workshop will introduce Rodriguez's approach to filmmaking by screening several of his "10 minute flick school" featurettes and we will explore if and how these techniques translate to software development in a lively group discussion.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12730	Incremental Releases Your Users Will Love: How to deliver functionally complete releases without blowing your brains out	One of the benefits of Agile Software Development is early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Dividing development work up into small pieces (user stories or backlog items) then building the most valuable parts first sounds like a simple idea, but there's often a bit more to it. Sometimes it takes a few not-so-valuable parts to allow users to take advantage of the most valuable parts. At times the most valuable parts may show well, but without a sufficient amount of software implemented, users may be unwilling to set aside legacy software or even manual processes to actually put the new software into use and earn the return on investment incremental release should bring. In this short tutorial participants will learn the basics of planning incremental releases that are useful to their users. We'll discuss strategies for splitting user stories into the small but useful parts that allow releases to contain more user stories. You'll learn more about the myth of the finished user story and why, if you're not cautious, your stories may inflate while you're not looking.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12731	Refactoring Games	Learning code smells and refactorings can aid in our communication and deepen our understanding of design and how to evolve it. But many developers fail to find the time to study code smells and refactorings on their own. In this session, you will learn to play several games that teach code smells and refactorings. We will use decks of refactoring playing cards that include cards for code smells, refactorings, and qualities of good code. These games have been used in many workshops and have proven to be both effective and fun. You will also get your own deck of cards so that you can play these games with your friends and project teams.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12732	The Role of the Customer Team	Agile processes require that developers have a close working relationship with their customers. What is the nature of this relationship? This tutorial explores this question, and defines and explains the set of responsibilities the customer has. Two things that are certain are: 1. The existence of a good customer is a primary success factor; and 2. Being a good customer is one of the hardest things to do. The exploration starts small. The two most popular small-team agile methods are eXtreme Programming (XP) and Scrum. Superficially, one would suppose that XP's Customer and Scrum's ProductOwner were "one and the same", but closer inspection shows that there are both similarities and differences. By studying these (and other) processes' views of customers, we arrive at a small set of primary responsibilities for the customer: - Determine what the stakeholders want / need from the System; - Prioritize what will actually be developed; - Refine the requirements with the development team; and - Validate that the System delivered is the one agreed upon. To get all of this done usually takes a collection of people we call the CustomerTeam. In this tutorial we describe the challenges in detail and give some tentative solutions.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12733	Functional Acceptance Testing: The Essentials	Functional testing is challenging whether you are working on an agile project that develops tests before developing system code, or working on a more traditional project that has left functional testing until the end. Different choices must be made in each situation in order to develop a successful functional testing strategy. It is crucial that automated functional test suites employ established testing best practices in order to avoid common pitfalls. Topics covered include: 1. Context: How functional tests fit into the overall spectrum of testing. Where functional tests fit into the overall project development cycle. 2. Strategy: A functional testing strategy is a collection of decisions relating to creating, maintaining, and executing functional tests. Various project characteristics drive these decisions. 3. Specification: Functional tests can be textual, graphical, tabular, or storyboarded. Emphasis is placed on developing a domain specific testing language, and other best practices for making your tests a valuable project asset. 4. Automation: Several tools are compared with respect to readability, maintainability, declarativeness, effort, results reporting, etc. 5. Case-Study: Description of a project that evolved its focus over time (from porting to enhancements), and how the functional testing strategy was developed to evolve successfully.

12734	Agile Before They Know It: Tips for Agilists in a Non-Agile World	"If only my project were more agile!" How many times have we heard, and made, this plea? As Agilists, we long for something better than what we have. We try to influence our projects to be more agile. Sometimes we have great success, but other times it just doesn't seem to click. This workshop is an opportunity to share simple, practical tips for Agile conversion that work. Imagine a swap meet where tools for Agile adoption are shared, explained, demonstrated and practiced. We will diversify our toolboxes so that when we go home to our respective projects, we can be a little less frustrated and get a little more done. We may back off the wrecking ball in favor of the surgeon's scalpel. In fact, our coworkers may find that they're Agile Before They Know It!	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12735	Agile Architecture	Let's say your team has been Listening Testing Coding and Refactoring along for years. You've said everything there is to say Once and Only Once. You check your velocity from the burndown on your information radiator at the end of every sprint, so you've got that process thing down...and all of a sudden that's just not nearly good enough any more. How could a Lego model of a steam locomotive provide deeper insights into architectural choice in an agile environment that could get you out of that fix? Join this interactive tutorial to experiment, challenge and develop ideas about "architecture" and "merciless refactoring". You'll come away with a new insight into the techniques that long established Agile teams are discovering to obtain the step-changes in productivity that business demands.

12736	Earned Value and Agile Reporting	This paper reviews the concepts of Earned Value Reporting established in traditional project management, and determines whether and how they can be applied to software development projects following an Agile methodology. First the origins and concepts of Earned Value, are reviewed followed by its application in traditional projects. Then the application of Earned Value Management to Agile software projects is investigated.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12737	An Empirical Study of Using Planning Poker for User Story Estimation	Group estimation of user stories is an important part of most agile processes, used for both planning and pricing. Research has shown that although group estimates in many cases are superior to individual estimates, there is still a need for improvement. For instance, group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant personalities and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user story estimates made by an agile development team, we investigate whether the introduction of a voting process, derived from Wideband Delphi, improved the estimation ability of the team. The results show that the voting technique improved the team's estimation ability in most cases, but that it increased estimation error in the extreme cases. We believe that the voting technique can improve agile teams' ability to deliver promised functionality on time, improving time-to-market.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12738	AgileEVA - Earned Value Management in Scrum Projects	AgileEVA is a simplified set of earned value calculations. Adding AgileEVA to Scrum yields simple and effective what if scenarios for balancing scope, schedule and budget. The balanced information helps keep focus on "return on investment." Using only five initial values and four data points, AgileEVA adds almost no overhead to a Scrum Project and adds particularly valuable cost performance information which is important for helping measure productivity improvements. For organizations required to use Earned Value Analysis (EVA), AgileEVA provides additional support to assert that Scrum is a viable project management method. Using AgileEVA will help organizations familiar with traditional project management interpret the results of Scrum projects. For organizations running Agile projects, AgileEVA contributes to balanced practices. AgileEVA is intended to help ScrumMasters, Project Managers, Product Managers and Key Stakeholders involved in project delivery. This is especially true for organizations struggling with the implementation of Agile software development.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12739	Extreme Test Makeover	Are your tests disheveled, flabby, or unfocused? Bring them in for a makeover! We’ll have makeover artists who are experts in unit and acceptance testing, with tools such as Fit, JUnit, NUnit, Watir, and more. This is a hands-on session – bring your laptop with your tests and a development environment, running and ready to test. Or just come and observe how the experts work. Your application can be a toy or a real application, though we really encourage you to bring a real application. We’ll have two tables with multiple sessions per day—90 minutes each (including a little overhead time). We’ll have sign-up sheets for each slot. At the end of each session, we’ll capture “lessons learned” and share them with others at the conference.	Hands-on	Workshop	2006

12741	Demonstrating Responsibility: The Mindset of An Agile Leader	Demonstrating personal responsibility is the first step in leading anybody, changing anything, solving any problem, and managing every relationship. Everybody knows that. But not everybody knows how to take responsibility. More importantly, even highly responsibility people do terribly irresponsible things on a frequent basis because they don't understand the Responsibility Process. The failure to take responsibility stalls projects. And it's a leading reason why smart executives fail. This tutorial will show you: - why agile leaders success soars when they take 100% responsibility - the inner workings of personal responsibility and how to tap into it at work, and - exactly what to do to take personal responsibility for your agile projects and to build responsible leaders, teams, and communities.

12742	Overview: Agile Styles	There are many ways to practice agile development. The speakers in this session will each spend 30 minutes talking about a specific style of agile development. This session will provide insights that may help you determine which agile style might be a good fit for your company and culture. The speakers and the topics are: Kent Beck on XP, Ken Schwaber on SCRUM, Mary Poppendieck on Lean, Jean Tabaka on DSDM, David Anderson on FDD, and Alistair Cockburn on Crystal. If you are new to agile, do not miss this session - a gathering of this group of speakers is a unique experience.	Beginners	Tutorial	2006
12743	Rapid Testing Approaches for Agile Development	Agile processes are sometimes disparaged by traditionalists because agile teams prefer working software to comprehensive documentation. Yet some agile adherents, in their choices of testing strategies and tools, may themselves run the risk of producing more documentation and doing less testing than they might. Rapid Testing, a complete methodology designed by James Bach, shares the anti-clerical, anti-bureaucratic point of view espoused by agile proponents, and focuses on providing feedback quickly through rigorous, aggressive, mission-focused testing. Rapid Testing also encourages teams to expand ideas about testing, to make pragmatic choices about test automation, and to investigate the product to find important bugs quickly. In this Discovery Session, Michael Bolton provides an introduction to Rapid Testing - defined as the fastest, least expensive testing that fulfills the mission. Rapid Testing is built on thinking skills-general systems thinking, critical thinking, and context-driven thinking - but it's also focused on action, lightweight tools, and rapid cognition. Michael will highlight the central skills and practices of the approach, show how it fits in an agile environment, challenge some dogma, welcome discussion and debate, demonstrate quick tests that provide some information at minimal cost, and present several exercises from the Rapid Software Testing course.

12744	Is Your Organization Ready for Agile?	Topic: How to assess organizational readiness and lead the change to agile development Agile software development sounds really great. Higher productivity, better return on investment, quicker delivery of software, motivated and energetic developers are all appealing. Are you willing and able to do what is required to get these benefits? Some people think all you have to do is read books, take courses, and then implement Agile. But the work is much deeper and harder and has many aspects of organizational change management. This tutorial will help you understand how to assess your organization and determine whether the conditions are right to make a change to agile a success.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12745	The Lego XP Game	This variation on the classic XP game has been used effectively as a teaching tool within ThoughtWorks and with our clients. Unlike the traditional XP game, where the tasks being worked on are unrelated and repetitive, instead each team will iteratively develop a series of models. Whilst we talk specifically about XP, many of the topics covered are generic to all agile development methodologies.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12746	Agile Practices II	Adding to the introduction series, the speakers in this session will each talk for 45 minutes, diving deeper into various agile topics. Scott Ambler will discuss agile modeling and how it fits into agile development. Joshua Kerievsky will talk about the challenging and important concept of evolutionary design. Esther Derby will talk about the many team dynamics that lead to successful adoption of agile, and Mike Hill will conclude the session with an overview of essential todos associated with healthy transitions to agile development.

12747	Speed Boats & Jacuzzis: Innovation Games(sm) For Customer Understanding	Modern product development practices, especially those that focus on innovative products and services, place great emphasis on having development teams work directly with customers. This is good news, for the foundation of innovation is a genuine understanding of your customers. This tutorial tackles the challenge of developing customer understanding head on by providing you with a fresh perspective on how to use a variety of games with your customers to develop the understanding you need to create innovative, successful products and services. You'll find that if you use them, you'll come to understand what your customers really want. You'll have fun doing it. Perhaps more importantly, they'll have fun doing it.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12748	Tracer Bullets Reloaded	It's not about hitting a target, but rather constantly checking that you are heading in the right direction. It is better to include early attempts and take small steps to improve your aim. In this workshop attendees will experience an extreme simulation of building software using the principle of extensive feedback and evolution, which is at the core of XP. Teams will have to build a product from things like wood, sticky tape and pins in a non-software game within a short timeframe. In our experience of working within agile teams, we have found that it is just as important to apply the principle of extensive feedback and evolution to the development process as it is to the software itself. The XP values and core practices can be used as a recipe to create a specific XP flavour within a team environment. Using feedback, one can then adjust the recipe to taste. The workshop is structured in such a way that we investigate and apply this principle and, through coaching and reflection, we expect to draw conclusions that show how to make the process itself as agile as the software developed.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12749	Skills for the Agile Designer	What makes an agile designer effective? Agile designers need to quickly see the essence of a problem, shape reasonable solutions, and communicate complex ideas. When things don't exactly go according to plan, they must react, readjust their thinking, and try again. This tutorial introduces several techniques and vocabulary for articulating the nature of design problems and their solutions: Problem frames identify the typical structure of software tasks. Designer stories set the stage for collaborative design. Role stereotypes are useful for assigning or assessing object behaviors. Control styles can help characterize and communicate control center designs. Trust regions can aid in spotting places where defensive programming is needed. Seasoned designers strike a balance. They know the difference between core and revealing design tasks and plan accordingly. When unanticipated difficulties crop, they adapt their work rhythms. We'll outline strategies for identifying and tackling wicked problems that can't be solved by sheer effort alone. Finally, we conclude by introducing argument moves so you can analyze others' positions, think critically, and hopefully hold your own in a heated discussion.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12750	Do Less and Deliver More; Lessons from Lean Production.	For everyone new to agile methods, this workshop will give you hands on experience with how agile methods work. For individuals experienced with agile, this workshop will give you deeper insights into why agile methods work and how to accelerate your results. Participants will run a business simulation, where teams compete to produce products in a marketplace. The simulation will surface issues that recur in the real world, giving participants an opportunity to try out new behaviors and beliefs to resolve these issues. As teams review financial and operational metrics, they will iteratively refine their approach and discover key principles from lean production, theory of constraints, and product development. The group will link these principles to software development and understand how higher performance demands agile practices. Attendees should dress comfortably as this experiential learning activity will require a great deal of movement around the room. The presenters have run this simulation many times for audiences ranging from executive management to development teams adopting agile. Attendees have described this workshop as "illuminating, an eye opening way to accelerate software development."	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12751	Refactoring with Contracts	Design by contract is a practical methodology for developing code together with its specification. The contract consists of class invariants and method pre- and postconditions. As the code is refactored, specifications of internal units change with the code. There are mutual influences between the code and the contract. The assertions that constitute the contract are Java expressions; refactorings such as Rename Method must change these assertions as well as the code. The contract has methodological implications, which serve as preconditions on some refactorings; these must be checked before performing those refactorings. In addition, some contract modifications follow from certain refactorings, and can be done automatically. Development environments that support design by contract must take these influences into account. We report on the implementation in Eclipse of several refactorings that involve both code and contract. These show how contracts are modified in response to code changes, how contracts prevent certain changes, and how new contracts are computed for newly-generated methods and classes.

12752	Executable Acceptance Tests for Communicating Business Requirements: Customer Perspective	The study investigates capability of executable acceptance test (storytest)-based specifications to communicate and validate functional business requirements. The central hypothesis of whether customers in partnership with an IT professional can effectively specify acceptance tests was supported. Learnability and ease of use analysis indicates that an average customer may experience difficulties learning the technique. Several additional propositions are evaluated and usage observations made.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12753	On Agile Performance Requirements Specification and Testing	Underspecified performance requirements can cause performance issues in a software system. However, a complete, upfront analysis of a software system is difficult, and usually not desirable. We propose an evolutionary model for performance requirements specifications and corresponding validation testing. The principles of the model can be integrated into agile development methods. Using this approach, the performance requirements and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis. We also discuss a rare experience in the field and how our model relates to the results of the case study.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12754	Implementing Agile Methods in Large Organizations	In the last couple of years agile methods have become increasingly mainstream. Whereas several years ago agile methods were being implemented in a few project teams in an organization, today CIOs and VPs of engineering are funding initiatives to implement agile methods widely in their organizations. This tutorial is about one such implementation at Kronos, a 500+ person software engineering organization, and how what we learned from this engagements can help others facing this opportunity. The presenters for this unique tutorial are Peter George, VP of Engineering at Kronos, Inc. a worldwide provider of workforce management software, Jim Highsmith, Sr. VP of Agile Practices at the Cutter Consortium, and Josh Kerievsky, Founder of Industrial Logic. This tutorial will cover this major agile implementation initiative from: Peter's initial investigations into improving software development; to a 6-week in depth qualitative and quantitative assessment done by Jim and Josh (and Michael Mah, a metrics consultant); to Peter's rationale for such a momentous change; to creating an implementation strategy and action plan; to the training and coaching of 40 project teams, to the results achieved by Kronos in the first year of this transition. There will be ample time during this tutorial for interaction with participants to discuss how this experience, and others, could help your organization's transition to agile.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12755	A Case Study on the Impact of Customer Communication on Defects in Agile Software Development	Effective communication and feedback are crucial in agile development. This has been emphasized especially in Extreme Programming (XP) which embraces both communication and feedback as interdependent process values which are essential for the project to achieve successful results. Our research presents empirical results from three different case studies with partially onsite customer and one with onsite customer. The case studies applied face-to-face communication to different extent and used email and telephone to manage customer-developer communication inside the development iterations. Our results indicate that increased reliance on less informative iteration time communication channels resulted in higher defect rates. These results suggest that the selection of communication methods to be used inside development iterations must be paid significant attention by agile organizations working with partially available customers. This paper also proposes some guidelines for selecting proper communication methods.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12756	The Role of Story Cards and the Wall in XP teams: a distributed cognition perspective	Much of the knowledge used within an XP team is tacit, i.e. it is hidden and intangible. Two tangible artefacts that carry information about the team's work are the index cards which capture stories and tasks to be implemented and the wall where they are displayed (which we refer to as the "Wall"). It is widely acknowledged that these are key elements supporting the work of the XP team, but no systematic investigation of their role has been reported to date. In this paper, we focus on the use of these artefacts within one XP team. We use distributed cognition, a framework for analysing collaborative work, to explicate the information flows in, around and within the team that are supported by the index cards and the Wall. We then interrogate the models produced using this analysis to answer "what if" questions.	Research	Research Paper	2006

12758	Context Driven Agile Leadership	Agile approaches have become increasingly popular among teams looking to shed unnecessary process overhead in order to maximize the velocity of business value delivery. However, it is a challenge to understand just what is "sufficient" and what is an appropriate leadership style for any given project. One thing that has become quite apparent is that what is "barely sufficient" for one project may be insufficient for another, or overhead for yet another. When looking at our project history, we observed two primary attributes that influenced the type of leadership process used: complexity and uncertainty. Starting from a core set of common practices, the assessment of these complexity and uncertainty attributes enable us to craft a process generally suitable for a given project. One benefit of this approach has been identifying these project drivers and providing earlier guidance to project teams so that they can start with a process that is close to appropriate.

12759	Introducing agile practices to your team or organization	Those who attend conferences or read articles see new ideas they want to take back to their organizations, but then struggle to make it happen. This struggle has become especially apparent of late as enthusiastic agile development proponents want to encourage their teams to apply these new approaches. The intent of this tutorial is to provide successful change management strategies to help these agile proponents.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12760	Delivering Flawless Tested Software Every Iteration	Are you delivering software iteratively, but still struggling with bugs and poor customer satisfaction? Many teams leap feet-first into agile development only to discover that it's not always easy to write good software without detailed requirements. Sometimes it seems like testers are running an iteration behind the rest of the team and are constantly playing catch-up. This tutorial introduces the agile acceptance testing process. Automating acceptance testing is a big part of the picture, but even more important is agreeing as a team on key attributes of the system being built. This tutorial heavily emphasizes building consensus so that by the end of the Iteration Planning Meeting, the whole team agrees on exactly what to build. We'll discuss what makes a good user story, how and when to elaborate your stories with detailed acceptance criteria, and how to use Fit/FitNesse to turn those criteria into automated acceptance tests. We'll work through exercises and specific examples, so that participants leave knowing what they need to get started with agile acceptance testing.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12761	Systems Thinking - drawing causal loop diagrams to effect change	This session introduces systems thinking using causal loop diagrams (a.k.a. diagrams of effects). Systems thinking is a methodology independent tool for understanding team and project dynamics and for finding effective interventions. This tutorial is for software developers, project leaders, coaches, customers, anybody involved in (IT) projects. Participants are not required to have any knowledge or experience in systems thinking. In our work as software development coaches, we have noticed that changing your software development method changes your organisation. We have run into questions like: why can't the customer keep up with the programming team and what can be done about it? How can we get a team to start unit testing? Is the lack of unit testing really the team's biggest problem? We have found that systems thinking is a simple but powerful technique for finding answers to these questions. Participants will learn to apply the Diagram of Effects (or Causal Loop Diagrams) technique, to different situations in projects, teams, and organisations; they also have an opportunity to share experiences in a structured way. After this workshop, participants can apply systems thinking to effectively influence the dynamics of their software development projects, teams, and organisations.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12762	Agile Metrics and Diagnostics: Knowing When and What to Measure	Little has been written to date by the Agile community on metrics. Or, more precisely: few hard-and-fast Agile Metrics have emerged as effective measures. This might seem surprising, but perhaps the temporary and contextual nature of agile metrics explains the emergence of a more heuristic approach. Teams are creating metrics on demand, in support of their goals, applying their understanding of Agile principles and values to create useful measurement tools on the fly. We propose to call these local, contextual measurement tools diagnostics to distinguish them from more long-term metrics used to measure contribution to overall organizational goals. Since Team metrics or diagnostics are highly contextual, they need to be evaluated carefully to know if they are useful. We will present both long term metrics used by the business, and potential diagnostic measures used by the team. We will present our tool for evaluating diagnostic metrics for Agile teams, and invite participants to bring their own team metrics to evaluate with this tool. Together we will discuss both the agile diagnostics workshopped and the value of the tool itself.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12763	Test Driven Development in C++ Hands-on Tutorial	Test Driven Development is a state of the art software development practice. When using TDD, programmers get instant feedback that the code they are writing does what they intend. An open source test harness is used to collect, organize and automate unit tests for your C++ code. This class shows the motivations behind TDD, but does not stop there. Attendees get first hand experience at TDD. You will write code that has extremely high test coverage. You will see how tests can prevent many bugs. You will see how TDD can help programmers prevent memory leaks.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12764	Storytelling with FIT	This workshop is about how to write acceptance tests that are meaningful, focused, and understandable. On an Agile project, the acceptance test suite is the medium that bridges between the technical and business members of the team to ensure that the right functionality is delivered. The tests must be clear and understandable by both sides, which implies building a common language within the team. This was the original motivation of the FIT framework, and our workshop focuses on the communication aspects of writing acceptance tests. We will not be implementing or running any code during this session. The tutorial is designed to: * motivate readable acceptance tests (as specifications) * show the importance of declarative style testing vs. procedural testing * provide experience in growing an acceptance test language * pass on our experience of using FIT for acceptance testing on multiple projects.

12765	Running an Agile User Group	The local Agile User Groups around the world are playing a very important role in the Agile movement. They have been an important source of knowledge about Agile Software Development - and they have inspired a large number of individuals and organizations to lighten up their heavy processes. But how do you start a User Group?. Where do you find the members? How do you get people to sign up? Where do you meet - and how often? How do you run the meetings? Do you charge a fee - or is it for free? And last but not least - how do you find the time and energy to keep running your User Group. In this highly interactive workshop, we will share our experiences and ideas about starting and running an Agile User Group.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12766	Tool Words, Weapon Words	Like many other fields, software development uses jargon. IT is filled with terms borrowed from industry, architecture, and other work cultures. Such words are not just tools that help us describe what we do. Words also shape the context in which we work, in ways that serve definite (but unmentioned) agendas. In this session, we present models and tools to detect the use of such weapon words. We show how to deconstruct their meaning, understand the agendas they promote, and disarm them through their use in new, provocative ways.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12767	The Planning Game	This course will use the release planning game to explore various project planning strategies. The game is played in small groups of approximately four players. Both programmers and customers may play, in any combination. In each cycle of the game, the players plan and "implement" a product. Each time through, they learn some new lessons enabling them to plan and implement better next time. Scoring is based upon each team's total return on investment.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12768	The Agile Marathon	Many companies today are facing the challenges of moving their project teams to use agile development methods. Much of the discussion these days centers on dealing with the issues and hurdles that must be cleared for teams to achieve success on their agile projects. This paper is about our experience in what we're calling the Agile Marathon. The long-term view of how to maintain success after your team begins to see that they have achieved the benefits of using agile techniques. Our focus and experience is in commercial product software development. We hope to shed some light on the challenge of keeping agile success going over a long period of time. We have faced the challenge to keep our teams motivated and focused on releases lasting over 18 months; the same product, same people, just new releases. Once the team recognizes its success, a new phase begins where it becomes difficult to hold everything in place knowing you've got a long road to travel.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12769	Formalizing Agility, Part 2: How an Agile Organization Embraced the CMMI	Most large IT organizations need the best of both worlds - working software that supports ever-changing business needs, and a process for delivering software that is predictable, trainable, and auditable. Organizations with agile software teams often receive timely, cost-effective solutions of sufficient quality. Organizations with formal processes often benefit from industry-recognized certifications and robust process improvement mechanisms. Rarely does a single large organization achieve both. DTE Energy has such a combination; its lightweight yet CMMI-compatible methodology is now used across its 600+ person IT organization to deliver and support working software. Its small teams embrace core agile principles as they provide "just enough" solutions that satisfy maturing business needs. Yet they passed two formal SCAMPI appraisals toward CMMI Level III accreditation, scheduled for mid-2006. This report continues last year's popular experience report on the journey of DTE Energy's agile IT organization toward CMMI accreditation. This report briefly recaps their seven years of agile experience, presents governance mechanisms and change management techniques, and highlights their three-release, nine-month plan for CMMI Level III accreditation. Finally, this report offers suggestions on embracing a formal process framework that are applicable to any agile organization.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12770	A Tale of Two Projects	Why do some agile initiatives meet with resistance while others march on to success? How do agile techniques gain a foothold in traditional corporate environments? While the answers to these questions are undoubtedly complex and varied, we had a unique opportunity to experience and analyze the adoption of agile practices on two projects at a major car rental company which, although sharing many similarities including staff, professed commitment to agile process, architecture, and programming environment, experienced two drastically different outcomes. The first became bogged down and eventually went to production late, over budget, with fewer features than expected, and only reluctantly embraced by its user community. The second reached its first production milestone after only 12 weeks, was enthusiastically embraced by its users, and went on to become an unqualified success and a model for other software development projects at this company. In this presentation we will analyze the similarities between these two projects, highlight the differences, and draw conclusions about the factors critical to the success of agile projects in large corporate environments.

12771	Extreme Construction	Get a jumpstart on the basics of Agile Development and Extreme Programming (XP) in a day, without programming. This workshop will use non-programming construction techniques to teach most of the XP practices in a fun and interesting format. Build a non-software artifact using practices of XP. See how the synergy of the XP practices brings benefits to you and your organization. Many people have an interest in agile methodologies, and XP in particular. Managers need a way to evaluate XP from an institutional benefits perspective and knowing how it actually works can be a help in this. Programmers need to learn the practices before they can begin to effectively use them. They also need a way to see how their current development habits may be in conflict with XP practices. Educators and coaches want effective ways to introduce XP and build teams. This workshop can provide required background for all of these needs in a fun and informative way. This workshop has been given many times in industrial, conference, and academic settings. It has proven to be an effective way to train individuals and teams, and also to help a new agile team coalesce into an effective working unit.	Hands-on	Workshop	2006
12772	Homer’s Odyssey or My Year of Living Dangerously (Monsters, Magicians, and Domestic Enemies) in Agile Software Projects	In 850 B.C. the literary genius, Homer, captured the adventures of the well-meaning Greek, Odysseus, a young, who fought magicians, monsters, and even domestic enemies in order to return successfully to his home. In 1922, James Joyce, recounted the tale of Buck Mulligan echoing those Odyssean trials in his Dublin home. In 2000 A.D., the Coen brothers out of Minneapolis Minnesota, applied this same classical framework to their wacky film "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" In 2005 A.D., an agile mentor (me) out of Boulder Colorado dealt with her own cadre of magicians, monsters, and domestic enemies in order to return successfully to her home. In this offbeat presentation, I will compare the impediments and obstacles encountered by an agile mentor (me) with those detailed in Homer's classical reference. Through the presentation and dialogue, we will discover who plays which classical roles in an organization's effort to adopt agile practices: Cyclops, the Sirens, Poseidon, Circe, Cicones, the Lotus-Eaters, and even the good-and-faithful dog Argus. Each has its modern-day equivalents in agile adoption. We'll confront these pesky impediments and obstacles in agile projects along with advice about: how to recognize them; how to navigate around or through them; and how to know what actions work best in defeating them.

12773	Extreme Teams	This tutorial will examine some of the ways size, feedback, and communication effect how people work together in teams as well as how teams work with each other. The tutorial format consists of gaming, lecture, and discussion. Real life examples of various team collaboration strategies will be presented with guidelines for building communities of practice.

12774	The Pairing Session as the Atomic Unit of Work	We have an Extreme Programming team at a small company dedicated to the Agile approach. Our team of 7 developers decided to use the pairing session as the fundamental unit of work for all organizing, planning, estimating, tracking, and of course, pair programming. It's been a great way to structure the day, provide rhythm and facilitate partner swaps. Estimating and tracking in pairing sessions provides us real feedback for improving estimates, resulting in highly effective planning and an extremely stable velocity. We have been working in this way for about a year with wonderful results.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12775	Multiple Simultaneous Projects With One XP Team	Why take on multiple simultaneous projects with one XP team? Many people feel that too much time would be wasted task-switching, that the team would suffer too much from fractured thinking, or that a sense of team would be lost. For our group, multiple simultaneous projects is a reality that we needed to face. This presentation will describe some of the reasons why we feel working on only one project wasn't an option for our team, some of the problems we struggled with initially, and what approaches we've developed over the past year to deal with this situation.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12776	Value-Based Extreme Programming	Agile methods, such as Scrum and XP, are not known for carefully tracking to time and cost estimates. On most Agile projects, schedule slips are expected and cost increases are predictable. Every slip and increase has a large impact on total value delivered and we need to start acknowledging this fact. Furthermore, project overruns cause other high-value projects to be delayed or canceled, creating a negative value impact. What is missing in these methods is the concept of financial responsibility. Agile needs a better way to measure total value delivered and Agile methods should be more focused on on-time delivery. To ensure that the development process only generates software that provides the highest value for our customers, we need to schedule, prioritize, and deliver the highest value features without any waste. A research study by Jim Johnson at XP2002 showed that 64% of the features in a typical system are rarely or never used. Lowering the percentage of unused features would hugely boost the value generated.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006

12778	A Canary in a Coal Mine	Why has top management started to really, really care about Scrum. Scrum	Main	Talk	2006
12779	Agile Estimating and Planning	is a leading indicator about the overall health of the enterprise, its investment of funds, and - most importantly - its ability to effectively compete. Scrum provokes the most fundamental changes within an organization, changes that reverse over thirty years of waterfall thinking. This is extremely hard for customers and product management to understand and accept, much less for engineering to facilitate. However, when an enterprise's ability to survive is at stake, top management makes the change happen. This head talk will discuss this topic.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12780	Example-Based Specifications	Some tests are thinly-disguised walkthroughs of a user interface. Other tests are so voluminous that you suspect that even their author didn't read them. But some tests seem designed to facilitate conversations about the key objects and processes in a domain. How can we foster the latter style, to create specifications useful to both machines and people-including end users, product owners, testers, and programmers?	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12781	The Truth about Programmers and Testers	Most of today's process definitions mandate separating programmers from testers, not only to different teams, but often to different physical locations. This separation leads to testers and programmers treating one another as adversaries, rather than as members of the same project community. When members of the project community see each other as adversaries, the project can only succeed in spite of, rather than because of, their efforts. Project success, then, depends more on luck than anything else unless testers and programmers work together. In this workshop, participants share experiences and discuss how to create a harmonious relationship among testers and programmers, as well as trace project problems back to a lack of cooperation between these groups. We hope to gather ideas for how to detect and fix problems in communication and cooperation among programmers and testers.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006

It will explore the DSDM principles and approach and give the audience practical experience of timeboxing, prioritization, user involvement and team empowerment.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12783	XUnit Test Patterns and Smells; Improving Test Code and Testability Through Refactoring.	XUnit is the generic name name given to the family of tools/frameworks used by developers when developing automated unit tests. The community has now had enough experience with using XUnit to start cataloging "best practices" and "not so best practices" as patterns and smells. This tutorial introduces a number of these "test smells", describes their root causes, and suggests possible solutions expressed in the form of a pattern.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12784	Agile Requirements Workshops: Essentials for Planning, Design, and Facilitation	This experience-based tutorial will share effective, time-tested practices for planning, designing, and facilitating agile requirements workshops. Requirements are the foundation of all the software work that follows. It is both an art and a science to arrive at a shared understanding of those requirements efficiently and with "just enough" precision to begin prototyping or developing. Well-designed and well-run requirements workshops are one of the best ways to overcome the myriad of problems that arise from inadequate customer involvement and ambiguous requirements. The objective of this tutorial is to give attendees a toolkit of practices, reinforced with brief practice sessions and group discussions, that they can apply immediately to improve the quality of their project requirements efforts without lengthening the development effort.

12785	Coaching 101: A Role-Playing Session	The role of coach is an important one on a software development team that is trying to adopt or improve their use of agile practices. The coach's job is to teach new skills, offer encouragement, and provide feedback to team members as they experiment with new ways of working. Being an effective coach is difficult. Whether the coach is an external consultant, a regular employee, or just a team member acting the part, they often finds themselves in the position of trying to influence change and behavior without having the specific authority to do so. The successful coach is able to gain buy-in and to inspire others to follow their example. This discovery session allows participants to practice the "softer skills" that are essential in being an effective coach. It consists of a series of role-playing exercises in which participants struggle to decide what coaching interventions (if any) would be most effective in a variety of situations. In a safe environment, participants can give and receive feedback on their coaching style. The role plays are based on specific scenarios encountered by our Digital Focus coaches as they have worked with new teams adopting agile development.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12786	Simple Tools for Communication - A Balancing Act	The Agile Manifesto states: "we have come to value individuals and interactions over processes and tools". Tools and techniques are not enough for running your projects, you need "people tools" as well. We all know that for instance developers and customers fighting about who did what wrong doesn't make our projects finish early, yet it is hard to stop doing it. Especially when the pressure is on. This session provides tools and processes for individuals and interactions, to help you take a step towards peaceful, effective projects. This session is meant for anyone who wants to become more effective through: - awareness of how our way of communicating influences others and vice versa - consciousness of the change processes in self, others and the context so that we can surf the waves of change, rather than drowning in the surf of the waves This tutorial is based on the work of the family therapist Virginia Satir.

12787	Distributed Agile Game	The Distributed Agile Game is meant to be played by people who are interested in agile tools and practices as they are applied to a distributed team environment. The participants may have prior experience in distributed development, but this is not required. In fact, no software development experience is required. The game will be played by several small teams. Each team consists of analysts, developers, a customer, and a project manager. The team is subdivided into two parts; an onsite team, with developers, a customer, and a project manager, and a remote team with only analysts and developers. The remote team must communicate with the customer and onsite team via tin cans (no joke.) The game will start out with the most basic of communication and no toolset progressing through several iterations until finally reaching a full suite of tools and processes for improved communication and team "gel."

12788	What Lessons Can the Agile Community Learn from a Maverick Fighter Pilot?	For the agile software development community, agility is defined by the values expressed in the agile manifesto. But in concrete terms, what does it mean for a software project to be agile? US Air Force Colonel John Boyd defined agility as the ability to operate the Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA) loop faster than an adversary. Agility therefore depends on the tempo at which we can exploit the OODA loop, and it is culture, not methodologies or tools that determine our OODA loop speed. This definition of agility has implications for the software development community. This short paper introduces Colonel Boyd, the OODA loop, the factors which influence OODA loop speed and the possible research opportunities into software engineering culture we are considering.

12789	Reflections on Reflection in Agile Software Development	This paper analyzes the reflections of an agile team, developing a large-scale project in an industry setting. The team uses an Iteration Summary Meeting practice, which includes four elements: The customer's summary, a formal presentation of the system, review of metrics and a reflection. The technique for the entire meeting and for the reflection element in particular is described, and empirical evidence is given to show that it is assessed as highly effective, achieving its intended goals, and increasing team satisfaction. Further, the proposed practice supports tracking of ongoing decisions. It is shown to be valuable to stabilizing a new project as well as a continuous improvement forum for a stable one. It also incurs a lower overhead than existing alternative reflection practices.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12790	Critical Personality Traits in Successful Pair Programming	Pair Programming (PP) is a common practice in Extreme programming, in which two programmers work together using a single computer. The close interaction required by PP makes it difficult to apply. The hypothesis is that certain personality traits are crucial for the success of PP, and PP partners should be chosen based on these personality traits. In this research, we first survey the programmers in industry to identify the perceived important personality traits for PP, and then conduct experiments to determine the significance of these personality traits in successful PP.

12791	The Principles of Agile Design	It has been said that Agile Software Development improves the design of software. What are the principles of that improvement? How do we know that certain refactorings should be undertaken? How do we know when certain patterns should be used. In this set of tutorials we will discuss the principles of Object Oriented Agile Development. These principles guide software developers in the management of module and component dependencies so that they can create systems that are highly flexible, expressive, maintainable, and decoupled.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12792	Coaching Software Development Teams	When we first get into software development, we concentrate on technical skill. We learn how to program, how to debug, and how to design effectively. If we are lucky, we work in an environment where most of that work isn't wasted effort. Most of us gradually realize that we are sensitively dependent on our team. The way that we interact with our coworkers, and they interact with each other, can make work productive and fun, or wasteful and hellish. In this tutorial, I'll outline techniques you can use to help software development teams overcome obstacles, gain confidence, and work well with their surrounding organization. You'll learn when to use them, and more importantly, when not to as you work with your coworkers to make your team more fun, effective, and humane.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12793	The Deployment Production Line	Testing and deployment can be a complex and time consuming process in complex environments such as application servers, messaging infrastructure and interfaces to external systems. We have seen deployments take several days, even in cases where teams have used automated builds to ensure their code is fully tested. In this paper we describe principles and practices which allow new environments to be created, configured and deployed to at the click of a button. We show how to fully automate your testing and deployment process using a multi-stage automated workflow. Using this "deployment production line", it is possible to deploy fully tested code into production environments quickly and with full confidence that you can fall back to a previous version easily should a problem occur.	Research	Research Paper	2006
12794	The Cost of Code Quality	The paper investigates the limitations of different agile coding methodologies and finds the boundaries within which those methodologies are effective. Using data from 80 development projects, the paper attempt to answer the question: How much effort should be invested into code quality? It is shown that a "quick and dirty" approach is actually preferable in some situations. Requirements volatility, expected breadth of usage, customers' defect tolerance, cost of defect fixing and system lifespan are suggested as the main factors determining how much effort to spend on improving code. The conclusions are used to demonstrate situations where XP coding practices are inefficient and to find boundaries within which simpler, less expensive methods give better results.

12795	Appropriate Agile Measurement: Using Metrics and Diagnostics to Deliver Business Value	Agile Software Development continually measures both our product and the process used to create it, to allow improvement. With increased popularity, more risk-averse groups are being drawn to Agile, bringing with them modes of evaluation incompatible with Agile values and principles. These outmoded metrics drive dysfunctional behaviors which threaten the integrity of an emerging Agile culture. This paper collects some of the current thinking on appropriate Agile metrics, and proposes simple tools which organizations or teams may use to develop more congruent ways to measure Agile work.

12797	by TBD	In order for a business to respond to rapid changes in its competitive environment, application development must be able to provide rapid and sometimes daily turnaround on changes, enhancements, and new functions. The agility the business requires from application development organizations is not exactly the same capability as described in most books on agile methods.  This talk will review the demands application developers must satisfy to support agile businesses.  It will compare these demands to the current practices and principles of agile methods to suggest where they are aligned and where they may conflict.  Some problems in business process management will be discussed in relation to whether they are helped or hindered by agile methods, and some new perspectives on agility will emerge.	Main	Talk	2006
12798	From Concept to Cash: Managing the Pipeline	Deciding what collection of development opportunities will be funded is one of the most challenging problems that development managers face. Not only are these decisions are crucial for the long term health of the organization, they have a huge impact on the ability of development teams to adopt lean principles and agile practices. This tutorial will look first of all at innovation: discovering and nurturing brilliant ideas that delight customers. Then it will consider how to keep the pipeline flowing with new applications and features without exceeding the capacity of the development teams to deliver.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12799	Project Status: Writing on the Walls	How is your project doing ? How long does it take to find out what's going on? Where is the essential information? Is it hidden, squirreled away inside thousand-line code files, spreadsheets and Word documents ? Or is it "in your face", shown where you can't help but see it every day ? A successful project isn't successful because the team makes no mistakes, or suffers no setbacks. Whether your project sinks or swims is determined not by circumstance but by the speed and quality of your team's response. This tutorial presents simple techniques to make project status visible early and continuously, so a team can respond effectively. The techniques can be implemented with simple office tools: flipcharts, markers and yellow stickies.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12800	Agile Factors	When a team sets out to apply agile software development on a project, there are a bunch of parameters and variables that need to be set. For example, how long will their development cycles be, when pair programming makes sense, who maintains tracking information, etc. This workshop aims to provide a guide to teams on topics that they will need to develop working agreements on and help team get clear about how they want to apply agile techniques.

12801	Dispersed Agile Development	Until very recently the only way of learning how best to operate a dispersed team was to try it. This tutorial provides a shortcut: the presenter has been part of several dispersed project teams, and has learnt the hard way what works and what doesn't. He has also benefited from extensive communication with others who have gained similar experience. The tutorial explains why dispersed agile development might be attractive and appropriate, how best to organize a dispersed team, what tools to use, and how agile practices fit with dispersion (or not).

12802	How BMC is Scaling Agile Development	Title: Successfully Scaling Agile: Tales from the Trenches at BMC Software Sure, agile development works for small teams. But what happens when you use agile development for a project that involves 200+ developers and testers spread from India to Houston to Israel? In less than a year, BMC Software's Infrastructure Management division transformed their development organization using agile development practices to deliver a major replacement product to the market in less time with and higher quality than previously possible. Along the way, we encountered significant challenges - from skepticism on the agile approach to coordinating distributed teams to less-than-optimal organizational structures. We learned how to expand agile beyond the development team to advance the relationship between product management; and how to meld the existing engineering practices and business processes we still valued with changes required by our new agile world. Most importantly, we got our first taste of how agile can enhance the value we deliver to our customers. Using the format of a release retrospective, we will share our firsthand experience and hard-learned lessons on how to successfully scale agile to transform a large and distributed development organization, and how we're expanding these successes to create a highly responsive agile enterprise.

12803	Lessons Learned from an eXtremely Distributed Project	Distributed projects are fraught with problems of visibility, communication and tacit knowledge flow. These combine to reduce productivity and increase project risks and setup costs. The potential savings of distributed development can be all but wiped out by these problems. Before embarking on a distributed project we should evaluate the potential project risks against the financial benefits and determine the best approach to establishing the distributed teams and processes for supporting delivery. On a recent 30 person, multi-site, urgent project we saw a number of serious problems arising from the distribution of our team. The most serious problems we saw were with tacit knowledge, communication and visibility. To combat these we tried a number of techniques including stand-ups, story boards, video documentation, remote desktops, instant messaging, voice-over-ip and continuous integration. We will describe each problem area we faced, and the lessons learned applying each technique to the problem. Conclusion: Despite using these techniques, the impacts of a distributed team out-weighed the financial benefits. Looking back, we believe that this project was not suitable for distribution, and would generalise that many distributed projects would be in a similar situation.

12804	Agile Testing of Web Applications using WebTest	WebTest is an open source acceptance testing tool which extends upon the Apache Ant declarative build tool to allow declarative specification of tests using an XML syntax. No extensive programming is required to make use of WebTest however programming skills can be used to customise and extend the tool. In addition scripting languages such as Ruby, Python or Groovy can be used within your tests. WebTest has a main focus on testing web applications but can also test PDFs, Excel Spreadsheets, XML Web Services, files and Email delivery systems.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12805	Enhancing Diversity in Agile Software Development Environments	Diversity can be expressed in different ways, such as nationalities, worldviews, gender and minorities, cultures, skills and life styles. In general, studies tell us that no matter how diversity is expressed, it benefits with societies that foster it. In this panel we highlight the notion of diversity in agile software development environments. The panelists will present their perspective at the topic, each one based on his/her own professional experience (academia, industry and consultation), specifying how diversity can be expressed and fostered.

12806	XP Geography: A Guide to Mapping Your First Steps	We will start by discussing why and when to use XP and how to jump into the pool and get started. Next we will explore the primary practices of XP in detail using mind mapping exercises. You will examine your needs and find practices to address them. We will discuss the change process, how to reach agreement on goals and principles, how to implement new practices and how to sustain them. You will make a plan to share with your team and set up incentives for accountability. This tutorial will be interactive and involve many colored felt pens.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12807	Agile User Interface Development	Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have become an almost universal way of interacting with computer programs. GUIs provide a front-end to the underlying application code that makes software easy to use. Since most of the software development is GUI-centric, testing user interfaces is vital to ensure the system's safety, robustness and usability. Despite the fact that GUI testing is an essential part of software development, most developers don't do test-driven development (TDD) of the user interface because it is complex and error-prone. This hands-on tutorial presents techniques to develop user interfaces using TDD, as well as testing existing user interfaces. The audience will learn how to test Swing GUIs using Abbot and Costello and web user interfaces using Selenium. While the principles for testing rich GUIs are focused on Java, the techniques for testing web user interfaces are applicable to many technologies such as static HTML pages or dynamically generated web user interfaces created in Java, .Net, PHP, etc.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12808	Engaging the Customer: Empowering and Engaging customers and end-users in Agile projects	Agile approaches have long touted frequent "customer" involvement and feedback. But, in fact many organizations commonly use the term "Agile customer" to refer to the individual or team of people that guide developers by writing user stories, making decisions about development priority, and describing acceptance criteria. The demands of the Agile customer role don't always match up with the skills and availability of actual users of the software. Consequently the role is often filled by someone standing in for the user. On many Agile projects it may be difficult to find and successfully engage a system's actual end-users. But without them, we lose much of the benefit we'd gain from their frequent input and feedback. This discovery session will explore the involvement, successful and otherwise, of actual customers and users in the day-to-day software development process. Participants will learn about: * The range of approaches that can be used to involve customers and users; * Pitfalls common to those approaches; * Possible strategies to avoid those pitfalls. The discovery session will be hands-on, with participants collaborating together in small groups, then sharing and discussing results with all participants.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12809	Do You Get What You Measure?	In this workshop, we will work with the audience to explore the use of metrics to influence the evolution of development teams in a genuinely agile approach to Software Process Improvement. We will experiment with a selection of established performance and quality metrics and test their design to see what kind of behaviours they might encourage when they're applied. We will also explore "gaming" of metrics by development teams to hit performance targets without achieving the desired effects, and try to propose changes to the design of each metric which might make it more robust.

12810	Agile Estimation Techniques	Many software teams face planning and estimation with a sense of fear and loathing. Their feelings are hardly surprising considering that they are required to generate numbers based on relatively little information and are then held accountable to the accuracy of these guesses. However, it need not be this way. This tutorial presents some concrete, Agile tools and techniques for helping teams improve the accuracy of their estimates, while simultaneously making estimation faster and more fun. The tutorial is designed to be interactive, giving attendees the opportunity to share their experiences and participate in hands-on activities.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12811	Integrating Agile with the PMO	Agile Project Management techniques and tools are often at odds with those specified by the traditional Project Management Office (PMO). PMO's frequently prescribe, and check for adherence to traditional waterfall techniques; yet when projects have high risk and/or high exploration characteristics they better suit an agile approach. Both traditional and agile techniques strive for successful projects, but their differences in values, techniques and terminology can lead to conflict and confusion. The purpose of this Workshop is to identify and record practical processes, tools & techniques for integrating Agile project management into the PMO environment. Through the collection of existing successful approaches, capture of group contributions and open space problem solving a comprehensive arsenal of PMO alignment/transformation tools will be established.

12812	Ssh, we are adding a process...	Google is very successful in maintaining its startup culture which is very open and engineering-centric. In terms of the Agile Manifesto Google is almost entirely on the "left hand side" (with the exception of "Working Software"). Project teams don't have a project manager, but organize themselves and communicate directly with all stakeholders. Most feature decisions are made by the engineering teams themselves. As well as this works for products like search, gmail - it creates issues for the AdWords frontend (AWFE) application. AWFE is much more product management and release date driven then other Google applications. This presentation discusses how we carefully introduced agile practices to coordinate the AWFE development teams and made the process more efficient and predictable.

In this presentation, we will look at BT's journey to reform its IT capabilities. We'll look at the significant challenges or as we like to describe them opportunities that we encountered and the journey we needed to take, and are still taking, to resolve them. Some of the journeys we'll discuss include People Issues (transforming an overall organisation of 100,000 people with 8,000 in IT alone, low morale due to outsourcing and previous change initiatives, and strained relationships between IT and business); dealing with strict job roles in a large corporation; tackling project issues from the size of a team (8 to 800 people) through to the pragmatic application of Agile techniques in mature (not green-field) projects; solving the lack of Agile experience in a large organisation; constructively dealing with immensely distributed teams and, finally, addressing the need to understand cultural issues involved in outsourcing.

12814	Something to Believe In	In 2005, we initiated the Agile Workstream to enable an agile development process in one of the major divisions of our company. Our strategy was to prove out the process with an initial project and extend it other projects and teams around the group. At the time of this writing, development is still underway, but we are nearing the launch of this new product and the business remains enthusiastic about the agile process. The journey has not been easy, however. We had to learn how to integrate other disciplines in the process, work with teams that are not agile, learn hard lessons about keeping release plans up to date, and educate senior management about the process while meeting their expectations about budget and delivery - all of this under an intense spotlight in a very large organization. We still have a lot to learn and do, but what we discovered was that Agile became a beacon of light, a rallying call - it gave the group something real to believe in. Emboldened by the promise of what Agile could do, the organization began to change at multiple levels. We are now in the process of leveraging the results of the first project for other projects, learning new lessons about scaling up and institutionalizing the process.

Years of further training might be rewarded with a black belt, which is merely the sign of ascent to a different stage of learning. No master ever stops learning. If I want to learn object programming... my employer will pack me off to a three-day Java course picked from this year's issue of a big training firm's catalog. Nuts to that -- acquiring coding skills is not an "instant gratification" process.  The Coder's Dojo offers a way of teaching and learning programming in a more appropriate manner, respecting the depth and subtlety of the craft. A Dojo is a weekly meeting between programmers of varying skill levels. They come together as equals - in physical, not virtual space - around an ongoing series of coding challenges called "code kata". The first Dojo originated in Paris; others have started up in the US (Pittsburgh, PA), Finland, the UK... The intent of this workshop is to reproduce the mechanics of one Dojo session, to encourage participants to start their own !	Hands-on	Workshop	2006
12816	User Stories for Agile Requirements	The technique of expressing requirements as user stories is one of the most broadly applicable techniques introduced by the agile processes. User stories are an effective approach on all time constrained projects and are a great way to begin introducing a bit of agility to your projects. In this session, we will look at how to identify and write good user stories. The class will describe the six attributes that good stories should exhibit and present thirteen guidelines for writing better stories. We will explore how user role modeling can help when gathering a project's initial stories. Because requirements touch all job functions on a development project, this tutorial will be equally suited for analysts, customers, testers, programmers, managers, or anyone involved in a software development project.

12817	Humans: Designed for Interaction (Dynamic Intelligence in Agile Communication)	Customer meetings, planning meetings, design meetings, pair programming... You've reduced a lot of that written electronic and paper correspondence with the intent of providing more "face time" with each other... but is the project team up to the challenge? Unfortunately, difficult personalities, hidden agendas, and lack of participation are getting in the way. Sound familiar? Software development is rife with miscommunication and misunderstood intentions leading misdirected solutions, wasted time and fruitless effort. In this session you will explore new, revolutionary methods being used by psychologists and educators to peer inside the minds of those with social deficits, autism, and asperger's syndrome (http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html). With consistent application of six principles of Dynamic Intelligence (http://www.rdiconnect.com/RDI/DynamicIntelligence.asp), latent abilities can be drawn out of even the most reticent (or overly enthusiastic) communicators: - Emotional Referencing - Social Coordination - Declarative Language - Flexible thinking â€¢ Relational Information Processing - Foresight and Hindsight Together we will discover how to best employ these principles in the many face-to-face communication opportunities afforded by all agile methodologies, with a nod toward the XP values of "Communication", "Simplicity, "Feedback", "Courage", and most recently (and importantly), "Respect".

12818	Cynefin - Making Sense of Agile	People don't make rational decisions - it's not the way the brain evolved. Instead they make first fit (not best fit) pattern matches with prior experience and then retrospectively justify them as "rational". This is no way to run a development effort. This fact means that you either have to convey a new message in such a way that it "resonates" with an existing prior pattern of success, or disrupt those patterns so that people see things from a different perspective, with a disposition to act. The Cynefin sense-making framework provides an unbiased, pre-hypothetical basis for analyzing situations, issues and problems, and serves as a basis for discovering novel, oftentimes optimal solutions to them. This tutorial will introduce parts of the Cynefin framework, drawing on a decade of theoretical research and practical experiments to work with the reality of human decision making, and will cover: * Complex systems approaches to the forced evolution of systems. * New approaches to project management based on the ideas of social complexity, which legitimize formal, rapid and agile design methods within boundaries. * Gaining senior management acceptance to radical ideas. * The application of the Cynefin framework for problem-solving in the Agile domain.

12819	Agile Practices and challenges in the embedded world	Agile practices originated in companies and the minds of thought leaders that primarily engage in enterprise software development. Consequently, there is limited treatment or published material on how well agile methods map to companies that deliver embedded software. Of particular interest are companies that routinely develop hardware in parallel with software to run on that hardware. Companies like this tend to think their environments are distinctly different than pure software companies and thus can be skeptical of adopting agile practices for this reason. This session seeks to explore this topic in an informal way and will generate a prioritized list of issues that highlight the specific areas that make embedded software development unique and identify which agile practices are most important in this environment	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12820	What Are We Arguing About? A Framework for Defining Agile in our Organization	How do we implement Agile? Is Agile a good thing for my organization? What barriers will I have to overcome? All of these are important questions when deciding whether and how to apply Agile Software Development to an organization that is used to working in a different way. To enable a good discussion, the language of that discussion must be established. As Medtronic adopted Agile, we realized how important it was to put effort into the language. We established a framework for that language, organizing our thoughts into three areas: Principles, Practices, and Benefits. When talking with visionaries, evangelists, or Stage 4 learners, we speak in terms of Principles to understand WHY Agile is the way it is. With practitioners, pragmatists, or Stage 1 learners, we speak in terms of Practices to understand HOW to do Agile. With skeptics, we speak in terms of Benefits to determine whether Agile is a good thing for us. In most cases, an effective conversation needs to address all three perspectives. The framework and language help us determine whether issues are related simply to communication barriers, or are related to the decisions of whether and how to apply Agile to our world.

12821	Trouble in Paradise: The Open Source Project PyPy: EU-funding and Agile Practices	Can agile methods be employed in an Open Source project with a distributed/dispersed development style while also being funded by European Commission, following a fixed price contract model with structural requirements much more similar to plan-driven approaches? In this paper we will present the agile methods that made this hybrid structure not only possible but that formed the basis of a successful first year of the PyPy project. The PyPy project started as a grass root effort in the Python Community, building a highly flexible and fast Python implementation purely written in Python. After less than a year of work the community and the core developers started to work on a proposal for EU-funding (summer 2003). The partially funded EU-project started in December 2004 and have, in January 2006, successfully passed the EU review of the results of the first year. A consortium of seven companies and one university was created around and within the original community in order to fulfill the EU-contract.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006

12824	A History of Lean	Topic: This tutorial traces the history of Lean Thinking from 1800 to the present. It gives an historical perspective on the Toyota Production System and examines the thinking of its founders. The tutorial traces the route of lean thinking as it moved from manufacturing through operations and product development to software development. The principles of Lean Software Development are summarized in the light of this history. Benefits: Lean initiatives are spreading rapidly throughout the business community as executives look for competitive levers in an increasingly fast-paced business environment. Because lean thinking is popular with business managers and executives, it creates a framework for understanding agile software development that senior managers can relate to and support. This tutorial will take you down the historical trail of lean thinking and show how that trail inevitably leads to the best practices of agile software development.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12825	Organizing People Patterns for Improvement	This workshop is designed to engage participants in understanding and applying pattern languages in organizational settings. Participants will classify organizational, fearless change, experiential learning, feedback, communication, and active learning pattern languages (as well as others suggested by the attendees) against an improvement model that allows the relationships among the patterns to emerge. The starting model is “Autochthony,” a developmental model that shows how cultural aspects (i.e., history, beliefs and intent) combine with organizational/structural aspects (i.e., definition, collaboration and management), and delivery/action-oriented aspects (i.e., process, roles and methods/tools) to define a holistic approach to group advancement. By using, customizing or replacing this model, we hope the workshop will show how these “people patterns” interrelate and support each other with the goal of helping people who design their own future to “learn how to learn” to create it. The model is generic enough to support a complete agile overhaul, introduction of a few new agile practices, or adoption of a specific management technique like Scrum that requires cultural support. The output of the workshop is intended to be a set of “pattern dialects” that address scenarios for improvement in particular environments suggested by the participants.

12827	Crushing Fear under the Iron Heel of Action	Emotions can run high during a project; quite often these emotions are reflections of or related to fear. How much of what happens in your project is motivated by fear? Is your code full of type checks? Are there magical implementations that everyone knows are faster, even if we don't measure their performance? Is there code that no one dares to touch? Are there things you can't possibly tell the boss? Are there things that no one can say, or people that no one can work with? Do team members resort to sarcasm as opposed to honest and direct communication? Are project reports unclear or untrue? Is the real status hidden in a mountain of process-dictated forms, or buried in vague terminology of your own invention? We've been there, and done that, and we'll talk with you about it. It'll be interesting, it'll be entertaining, it'll be worth your time. In this tutorial we will discuss how to recognize when we are acting out of fear, and what to do about it. We will explore how fear impacts our projects and what actions we can take to crush it.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12828	Test-Driven J2EE	Experience Test-Driven Development by building J2EE components! Many students of Test-Driven Development are introduced to the subject through simple problems, such as the classic "Money" example from Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development: By Example. Although some people enjoy exploring new topics by tackling simple problems, there are those who would rather dive into the deep end, than merely get their feet wet. This tutorial is for those people. Test-Driven J2EE gives you the opportunity to practice the techniques of Test-Driven Development with J2EE components, including servlets, JMS and page templates. The goal is to build a small, but useful slice of a J2EE application while following the cardinal rule of Test-Driven Development: Never write a line of production code unless somewhere, a test fails. You will add a feature to an online Coffee Shop application, giving you an opportunity to see how to test-drive new features for existing systems, complete with typical end-to-end concerns, such as performance and security in a multi-tier application.

12829	Programmers are from Mars, Customers are from Venus: A practical guide to working with customers on XP Projects	This interactive and informative tutorial will introduce you to practices that will increase the effectiveness of the customer on your XP project. Customers have one of the most complex and difficult roles on a project, yet XP includes very few practices that support the customer in their role - the aim of this tutorial is to change that. Over the last three years, we have investigated many projects around the world to identify how customers succeed in this complex and difficult task - discovering not what people think should have happened, but what really happened and what actually worked! This tutorial distils this research, grounded in practical experience, into a 3 hour session, so that by the end of this tutorial you will have gained: * A realistic understanding of the complexity and difficulty of the XP Customer role. * An understanding of the key roles required on a customer team, both what they are and why they matter. * An understanding of the nine practices that enable customers to sustainably drive XP projects to successful completion - think XP practices BUT for customers.

12830	Community Reflections	The agile community / movement is growing and changing faster every day. As the initial agile flavors blend, the community continues to reach out, gathering new ideas from other communities and disciplines. One such practice, retrospectives / reflections, is an example of the agile community embracing an idea that harmonizes with the core principles of agile. As retrospectives and reflections are now a mainstay for many agile communities, this session is a way for the community to share in this practice. Using the fishbowl format, the session will start with a discussion among long time players in the agile community. Once the conversation is rolling, anyone interested may join the discussion, sharing their experiences or opinions. The moderator will be gathering questions for the fishbowl and keep the conversation flowing through the many topics present at the conference and during the session. Over all, this is a place for the community to meet and reflect on where we have been, what we have learned, and discuss topics and paths for the future.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12831	Introducing Agile Concepts in “Traditional” Environments	This session will explore how to present agile concepts to those unfamiliar with agile methods, but who follow some process probably based on waterfall concepts (possibly with iteration). A keynote and one Open Space session from Agile 2005 suggested that introducing, and selling, agile concepts was a topic worth addressing. Ideally, attendees would have some experience in trying to introduce agile concepts into their (or someone else's) environment. The key is how they explained and tried to adopt/adapt agile principles and values to an environment employing other methods/approaches. It would be very helpful for attendees to bring written positions/ideas with them (200-250 words) so they come with some pre-conference thought in place. The submissions would be collected at the start of the session and read during the session. Open Space would be used to continue the work/discussion started at this session throughout the week.

Over the last three major releases of the product, we have evolved from being primarily scope-driven to finely balancing scope and schedule over the entire span of the release. The most recent major release was planned to be diversified in scope and was delivered right on its planned schedule, fifteen months after the previous major release.

By being sensitive to the distinction between values and practices, which imperfectly express those values, we were able to implement agile without unnecessary cultural friction. The result has been one of the most successful projects in our region.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12835	The Agile/Waterfall Cooperative	In large organizations, it's simply not practical to just "flip a switch" and have your IT department start doing agile all at once. In these situations, agile pilot teams and existing waterfall teams find themselves having to figure out how to work together during the transition. In this tutorial, attendees will learn to factor their company's business needs into their existing agile procedures, and management will learn how to begin the investigative work of determining how to streamline these requirements and activities so that they don't hamper the project. Whether your agile project is dealing with waterfall-up-front (project approval process, for example), waterfall-at-end (separate system testing, for example), or waterfall-in-tandem (products so complex that multiple teams are required to work together to complete a release), you'll learn specific techniques that will make coexisting less painful. Attendees will learn specific points in the project where agile and waterfall teams must plan, coordinate, and review progress - both in the development of the product and in the viability of the transition plan. As not all companies will choose to move every single software development project to an agile paradigm, the agile/waterfall cooperative becomes even more important to master.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12836	Discussing the need for Agile Certification	Since software products are affecting the most critical areas in our lives, e.g. medical systems, security systems, financial systems, etc., shouldn't the Agile teams developing these systems be certified in similar ways? Those developers who have a college degree have often studied in non-software disciplines such as electrical engineering and mathematics. How do we know software teams made-up of diverse individuals have the proper background and skills to build a mission critical system using Agile techniques? With certain organizations being obligated to use a certified process, why isn't certified Agile one of their options? How should we go about creating a means for certifying Agile processes and teams? Should the Agile Alliance or similar body be responsible for certifying Agility? Is Agile ready for certification? Bring your ideas and we will facilitate an open discussion.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12837	Making Process and People Congruent	Agile processes suggest that they work better if developers and customers have particular characteristics, such as the capability to handle rapid change or to pair program. Members of an agile team cannot always be selected to insure that they possess these capabilities. The implementation of a process may need to be adapted so that team members can work effectively. This workshop investigates people issues that agile team members have faced and ways that those issues have been approached or could be approached.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12838	Adventures in Promiscuous Pairing: Seeking Beginner's Mind	Agile development practices are coming into the mainstream with a vengeance. This is evident by the number of books released annually as well as the exponential attendance growth seen at conferences such as Agile 2005 (and expected in 2006). This growth brings with it a lot of questions and a lot of experimentation as organizations figure out what works best for them and their projects. My team was no different. We were constantly experimenting with new techniques and approaches to problems. Some approaches worked, some did not. This paper discusses the adoption and experimentation of an Agile 2005 XR titled "Promiscuous Pairing and Beginner's Mind" by Arlo Belshee. It highlights the key success and unexpected problems that our team encountered while trying to implement the practices outlined in the paper, specifically around pair churn & team owned tasks, seeking Beginner's Mind and utilizing the least qualified person to do tasks. It also validates the unanticipated side affect Belshee identifies in his paper, introducing new team members and getting them up to speed.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12839	Automating Functional Tests with Selenium	Ever in search of a silver bullet for automated functional testing for Web Applications, many folks have turned to Selenium. Selenium is an open-source project for in-browser testing, originally developed by ThoughtWorks and now boasting an active community of developers and users. One of Selenium's stated goals is to become the de facto open-source replacement for proprietary tools such as WinRunner. Of particular interest to the agile community is that it offers the possibility of test-first design of web applications, red-green signals for customer acceptance tests, and an automated regression test bed for the web tier. This experience report describes the standard environment for testing with Selenium, as well as modifications we performed to incorporate our script pages into a wiki. It includes lessons we learned about continuous integration, script writing, and using the Selenium Recorder. We also discuss how long it took to write and maintain the scripts in the iterative development environment, how close we came to covering all of the functional requirements with tests, how often the tests should be (and were) run, and whether additional automated functional testing below the GUI layer was still necessary and/or appropriate.

12840	Presenter First: Organizing Complex GUI Applications for Test-Driven Development	Presenter First is a scalable strategy for producing fully unit tested GUI applications directly from user stories in a test-driven development fashion. Testing through the GUI by inserting events and making assertions on the state of the application is expensive and increases the burden of test maintenance. Presenter First uses a variant of Model View Presenter (MVP), a particular means of composing MVP triads, and a strategy for the order in which the elements of the triad are developed and tested. We have used Presenter First on projects ranging in size from several to several hundred MVP triads. This report and presentation will reveal the difficulties we encountered in scaling the use of MVP, discuss the approaches we tried and rejected, and describe our GUI application development best practices. It will also show how MVP triads can be effectively combined, and how and why they may be extended into more than three cooperating objects with the adaptor pattern. Finally, we'll demonstrate how particular tools decrease the burden of creating and maintaining hundreds of MVP triads in large applications.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006

12843	Refactoring Databases: Evolutionary Database Design	For years the norm for object developers was to work in an evolutionary (iterative and incremental) manner but for database developers to work in a more serial manner. The predominance of evolutionary development methodologies such as Extreme Programming (XP), Feature Driven Development (FDD), the Agile Unified Process (AUP), and the Rational Unified Process (RUP) it is clear that the two groups need to work in the same manner to be productive as a team. This workshop is organized into parts: A presentation where Scott and Pramod describe evolutionary database development techniques and a discussion where participants will describe their experiences with evolutionary database development. The presentation will describe database refactoring, evolutionary data modeling, database testing, the need for sandboxes, and configuration management of database assets. During the discussions attendees will be prompted to share their experiences with adopting and applying evolutionary database development techniques. Potential discussion topics include: Tool support for database refactoring; How to test your database schema; How to convince traditionalists to adopt these techniques; How can DBAs and agile developers work together effectively; and The challenges/impediments to adopting these techniques.

12844	Getting the Software You Need:  A Practical Approach for Stakeholders	You're a tester, business expert, project manager or analyst with an agile (or even not-so-agile) software development team. You write the stories/requirements/use cases and/or the acceptance tests. You're the judge of whether the delivered software accomplishes what you specified. You own or share responsibility for the success or failure of a software development project. How do you make sure you get what you and your business require? This tutorial will use a combination of hands-on exercises and lecture/discussion to teach practical skills that help you define clear goals for your team, define team roles, help different players work together, help business experts understand technical issues, measure progress, clearly communicate business priorities, clearly define and communicate stories and requirements, design tests to migitage risks, estimate realistically, plan at the project, release and iteration levels, leverage business experts' domain knowledge, and more. The tutorial will be tailored as much as possible to the needs of the actual attendees by means of polling them at the start and adjusting the content and focus accordingly. Participants will also learn from each others' experiences.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006

Creating these open environments requires attention to a collaborative model as well as continuing focus on small, daily interactions and information flows. Business prospers where teams can collaborate and contribute.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12846	Enterprise Scrum	Scrum is spreading through enterprises, either through bottom-up adaptation or through top-down management initiative. Either way, the depth and difficulty of the implementation is greater than might be anticipated. Our industry is used to planned "rollouts" of new approaches, but spreading Scrum throughout an enterprise is an extensive change process, focusing mostly on engineering/software development and customers and product management. It turns out that Scrum can't be used in isolation, but rather most of the dysfunctional behavior that organizations have garnered through years of waterfall development must be corrected The correction is made more difficult because the habits are deeply ingrained and unconscious.

12847	The Drawing Carousel - a Pair Programming Experience	Working in a single pair is different from working on your own: You have to articulate what you want to do, the other person (probably) has some different insights, and the result will be different from what you would have done on your own. But... this is only half of the story: working in a Pair Programming Team has many more advantages: knowledge is spread, the team creates an own style, parallel development becomes easy, truck factor is reduced. The team creates the product (instead of individual programmers creating the parts), the product is a whole, not a mixture of individual results. You will learn about the necessity of agile tools like daily standup meetings, pair rotation, coding standards and collective code ownership, how they work, and what their effects are. You will experience improvements for the quality of you product, and for the productivity of the team.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12848	The Agile Product Owner and Customer Field Guide	Effective product management has always been important to any successful development effort. The definition of requirements, prioritization of deliveries and alignment with business goals are no less crucial in agile processes. All of the most popular agile processes define roles responsible that perform these activities, most often call the Product Owner or Customer. Working through mechanisms such as the Product Backlog, User Stories and Release Plans, the Product Owner ensures the agile team receives a solid pipeline of well-conceived requirements. This intensive, hands-on tutorial provides you with a comprehensive toolbox of practices and techniques for agile product management. As each of the major responsibilities are explored, you will participate in exercises and simulations that enable you to gain direct experience to apply to your projects. This is participation-based tutorial, so prepare yourself to be actively engaged creating product backlogs and user stories, mapping requirements to agile project plans, working with stakeholders, and guiding a project to deliver the most value for your business. This half-day tutorial is intended for team members who are interested in gaining hands-on expertise in agile requirements management practices. Although no prerequisites are required, knowledge of the business, strategic product planning, and product management aspects of the overall development cycle is recommended. Familiarity with Agile development processes such as Extreme Programming or Scrum may be helpful.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12849	Ready, Set, Go Agile: A step-by-step guide for managers and executives	"You need to improve product development!" Maybe you are hearing this from your customers. Maybe your prospects. Maybe your staff, boss, CEO or Board. Maybe you are saying this to another. Maybe you are feeling the pain of missed released dates. Maybe it's poor product quality. Maybe even the wrong product. Maybe your best people are leaving. There are as many reasons as there are paths that lead people to exploring the benefits of Agile. If you're like most, you'll have many more questions than answers at this point. When is it right to become Agile? What does becoming Agile really mean? Is Agile an all or none proposition? How much will Agile cost? What are the likely benefits and risks of Agile on customers and the P&L? How will the organization maintain and scale Agility? For managers and executives, becoming Agile means numerous questions and decisions. This tutorial takes a few steps back and scrutinizes the big picture of contemplating and then successfully executing a transition to Agile. Using real world examples, managers and executives will be presented with and engaged in the realities, options and decision-making involved in becoming and remaining Agile.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12850	Hiring for an Agile Team	We work in all kinds of teams at work, and an Agile team and environment can be very different from other kinds of teams and environments. In successful Agile teams, people work differently, treat each other differently, can discuss certain issues more openly, and may be rewarded differently. All of those factors are part of hiring for a particular cultural fit, a key part of hiring for an Agile team. In this session, Johanna will facilitate your discovery of your unique characteristics and environment at your culture. Armed with that information, we will discuss how to ask questions and use auditions to hire for your team. We will create an environment in which you can practice your questions and auditions.

12851	Adding Usability Testing to an Agile Project	The PRI project consisted of two releases. The first release of the application did not incorporate any usability testing of the software and that resulted in the number of UI enhancements we had to build before the users would accept the release. For the second release of the project we incorporated paper prototyping, "wizard of oz testing" and usability testing of the nearly finished UI. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of usability issues raised during acceptance testing.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12852	A Tale of Two Writing Teams	This presentation is intended to provide participants with insight and experience related to technical writers' transition to and scaling with Agile teams. The session will focus on two case studies. Sometimes considered an "afterthought" in the product development lifecycle, writers often struggle to become part of a performing Agile team. Plagued with thoughts of inferiority, self-doubt and perceived (or real!) lack of recognition, tech writers can become lost when trying to transition from waterfall to Agile.

12853	How Not to do Agile Testing	When our team adopted Extreme Programming and Scrum, there were a number of challenges. Integrating an Agile team in a "traditional" organization created friction and conflict with management. The team consisted of volunteers new to Agile practices. We had difficulties with planning and estimation, task breakdown, managing requirements and working together in a collocated space. However, the biggest challenge the team encountered was not in any of these other areas, but in one that most of the team figured was simple: Testing.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006

12855	Agile Simulation	This course is a simulation of our agile software development process.  Its purpose is to show anyone who is associated with software development why agility works by simulating a software project.  No coding experience (or even direct experience of development) is needed.  The core game includes the roles of customers, business analysts, project managers and developers and is easily extended to include the role of testers and business owners. The simulation works by “building” an imaginary software product.  Each team works in an agile fashion, using simulated 2-week iterations.  “Event” cards create challenges and opportunities for the team.  They also include instructions on how to deal with good and bad events on an agile project..

12856	eXtreme Project Management Applied: How to deliver value in the face of volatility	No sooner do you say the word “plan,” when something else has changed.  Instead of managing priorities, you often find yourself prioritizing crises.  Traditional project management practices simply don’t cut in on today’s volatile, high-change, high-speed, high-stress ventures.  To succeed on these extreme projects, the new breed project manager needs to be able to unleash motivation and innovation, keep the project under control, deliver value to the customer each step of the way, and at the same time, ensure an acceptable quality of life in the process.  Based on his work with over 250 project teams from around the world, Doug, with the help of his African drum, will share proven principles, practices and tools that have been captured in his book, eXtreme Project Management: Using Leadership, Principles and Tools to Deliver Value in the Face of Volatility.

12858	Offshore Agile Maintenance	Predominantly the Agile literature covers applying the values and practices to a green field project using a co-located team. However, offshore/distributed development is the reality of the software industry. Offshore organizations have started with maintenance of non-critical business applications and moved over to green field development of business critical applications in a distributed fashion. Maintaining and enhancing business critical applications is the key to an organization's success. The existing literature states the following as challenges with distributed/offshore team: 1. Decrease in communication bandwidth 2. Lack of visibility into project status 3. Configuration management 4. Art of Command and Control structure 5. Cultural difference But based on my experience the above points are by-product of something more important. The root causes according to me are the following: 1. Lack of trust 2. Loss of context, both business and technical 3. Offshore team/s not getting equal stakeholder status 4. Abstraction of business and technical problems and decision In this discussion I would like to explain how we address the above issues and turned a failing project into a success story.

12859	Extreme Construction: Making Agile Accessible	In recent years agile software development methodologies have become important. Extreme Programming (XP) is perhaps the best known of these. XP involves about a dozen key practices that work synergistically to provide quality software in an environment in which change is likely to occur. Here we present an exercise that we have developed and used successfully to train novices in the techniques. This exercise is novel in that it is accessible to programmers and non-programmers alike. In an industrial setting, this makes it available to managers and customers. In the educational setting, it becomes possible to teach the techniques to novices before they have learned any programming. It is intended for those who intend to develop object-oriented (OO) software. Extreme Construction is a game that is both fun and informative. It teaches the fundamentals of any agile methodology while helping build a closely-knit team.	Educator's Symposium	Research Paper	2006
12860	Forming Successful eXtreme Programming Teams	XP is a lightweight process that provides principles for guiding projects and relies on the participants for its success. However, despite these guidelines, projects can be unsuccessful. We have previously identified that participants' levels of buy-in into the ethos of the methodology is a significant determinant of project success. This paper investigates how team formation influences buy-in and how buy-in, in turn, affects success, learning and working attitude within an academic environment. The empirical study shows that teams comprised of people with similar understandings of, and attitudes towards, the process tend to have a higher level of buy-in and, as a result, exceed their expected performance potential.

12861	The Impact of Agility on a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science	Shippensburg University offers a Computer Science degree with the choice of five concentrations including Software Engineering. We first introduced agility as an XP component in part of our two-semester product development sequence. Within the software engineering concentration, agile concepts spread into our course on Software Metrics and Process Management. With that experience, our faculty have become interested in including agile concepts into other courses. This paper describes how a number of our undergraduate courses, the content of our computer science core, and our department's general health have been affected by agile techniques and philosophies.

12862	Using Agile Management to Share Course Projects Among Multiple Classes	Project based courses have become popular as a way of engaging students and providing practical experiences. Sharing a single project between two course provides advantages of permitting more focus on the subject of each class, larger projects (more help and expertise is available) and greater opportunities for coordinated team work, and to appreciate how disciplines interact. A disadvantage is scheduling and managing class activities and risk to assure that useful project work is done at a pace benefiting both classes. This paper describes an experience in which an Agile approach was used to successfully coordinate project activities among a Software Development course and a User Interaction Design course.

12863	Examining the Compatibility of Student Pair Programmers	Pair programming has been shown to be beneficial for both students and teaching staff in university courses. A two-phased study of 1350 students was conducted at North Carolina State University from 2002-2005 to determine if teaching staff can proactively form compatible pairs based upon any of the following factors: personality type, learning style, skill level, programming self esteem, work ethic, or time management preference. We examined compatibility among freshmen, advanced undergraduate and graduate student pair programmers. We have found that overall 93% of students are compatible with their partners. Students notably preferred to pair with a partner that he or she perceived to be of similar or higher skill level to them, which can be predicted by grouping students with similar grade point average. Additionally, pairs comprised of a sensor and an intuitor learning style seem to be compatible, and pairs with differing work ethic are generally not compatible.

12866	The Crystal Methods, or How to Make a Methodology Fit	Just as projects vary in size, criticality and priorities, and so should your methodology. The strengths and weaknesses of the organization, the specific people, even the office layout affects how the team best works, and should influence the methodology. Crystal is a family of highly tolerant, lightweight methodologies built from core principles, techniques for tuning them to your specific situation, and specific examples to copy from. Inside the rule set for a Crystal methodology may be any topic or convention the team agrees to, including level of document detail and formality, reviews used, office seating and even quasi-unofficial parties. The Crystal methodology family aspires to be the most tolerant, habitable and yet effective methodology for any particular project team. Besides the Crystal family genetic code, this tutorial describes the principles and techniques for shaping a methodology to the project-team combination, introduces the colors in the Crystal family, compares different examples of the Crystal family to each other relative to the principles, and shows the differences between Crystal Clear and XP. Expect to learn the methodology tuning principles, and experience how easy and fruitful a methodology-tuning session can be.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006

12868	Tuning Up: A Team Leader’s Guide to Retrospectives for Agile Development	Agile development teams learn and improve by inspecting and adapting. High performing teams inspect and adapt not only their code and tests, but also their methods and interactions. Through regular retrospectives they become skilled at acquiring and using collective wisdom, accessing best practice thinking, devising meaningful experiments, and increasing opportunities for successful innovations. For teams to reap these benefits, Retrospective Leaders employ skills in design and facilitation for teams to reap these benefits. In this interactive workshop, based on a forthcoming book by the presenters, the participants will apply a framework for retrospective design and obtain experiential understanding of retrospectives from both a participant's and a retrospective leader's point of view. Participant will practice designing an iteration or release retrospective. Workshop topics include:  Overview of Retrospectives for Agile Development --Preparing for a Retrospective -- Retrospective Simulation -- Design Practice and Feedback: Choosing Retrospective Exercises and Activities	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12869	Discovering Whole-System Approaches to Enterprise Agile Adoption	More and more large companies are beginning to adopt Agile practices. However, many companies are facing new challenges in implementation. The project management and software development focus of Agile, as it is largely construed both in practice and in the literature, is often puzzling to senior corporate leaders and middle managers alike. The goal of this highly interactive and participant-driven Discovery Workshop is to gather insights, knowledge, and experience from among the participants that will advance thinking and practice for Enterprise Agile adoption. Of particular interest are "whole system" approaches that engage multiple management levels and diverse functional areas of the enterprise, from C-level managers to developers to support staff. The final output of the session will be a concrete artifact - something which others in the Agile community could learn from, and something which could be a foundational contribution to an emerging set of principles and patterns for Agile adoption in the large enterprise. This could be collection of Wiki entries, an article, or a white paper. Meanwhile, participants will also have gained a wealth of knowledge and insight which they can bring back to their workplace environments, as well as a support network of new friends and colleagues.

12870	Working Effectively with Legacy Code	Test Driven Development and Refactoring are powerful tools in the XP/Agile arsenal. With them you can add new code to systems and make existing code more maintainable. However, refactoring code without having tests in place can be hazardous. This tutorial presents a collection of dependency breaking and test writing techniques that can be used to get existing OO code safely under test for refactoring and enhancement. These techniques can be used in conjunction with Test Driven Development to breathe new life into large existing code bases.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006
12871	Multi-level Planning in Agile Environments	Participants will learn that extending the planning horizon beyond the iteration does not violate agile principles and can help project teams to set clear goals for a project. They will learn that estimation, prioritization and commitment is required for all people involved in the development of a product. They will walk away with a clear chart that summarizes which planning activities (prioritizing, estimating, committing) happen when, by whom and how. They will have built this chart themselves, adding understanding to the words, gained through discussions with each other and with the coaches.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006

This highly interactive and participative session will provide you a basic framework for understanding how organizations change. It will then allow a small group to drill down on several aspects of this change framework to provide each other hard won tips, generate or share tools, discuss techniques, talk about lessons learned, all while having fun. By the end of the session, we will have collectively created a complete toolset from over 30 concurrent such sessions for sharing with each other and the world.	Discovery Sessions	Workshop	2006
12873	The Psychology of Build Times: Keeping the Tests Fast Enough	Build times matter. Agile development methodologies rely heavily on the practices of continuous integration, automated testing, and frequent builds. As build times grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the effective use of these practices. A slow set of automated tests, for example, prevents many teams from running any tests often enough to get the kind of feedback that agile development demands. This tutorial introduces the psychology of build times and provides practical approaches for making tradeoffs in running builds and tests. We provide a guidance model for enterprise builds and discuss how distinguishing between different kinds of builds can be helpful. Common pitfalls encountered by agile development teams in automating builds and tests will be discussed. During the second half of the tutorial, participants will be challenged to revisit their understanding of different kinds of automated tests. Guidelines for helping teams distinguish between "slow" and "fast" tests will be given, and concrete coding examples will be provided to show how to improve the fast/slow ratio.

12874	Introduction to Holacracy™: A Framework for Agile Leadership & Decision Making	Agile software development harnesses self-organizing teams that adapt rapidly to change. This requires highly effective team decision making, the ability to rapidly evolve policy and process decisions as feedback arrives, and leaders that add expertise without resorting to autocratic fiat. This differs considerably from the usual top-down predict-and-control corporate model, and a more agile replacement for autocratic decision-making and management can dramatically improve productivity and quality of life for all involved. This session introduces Sociocracy, a system of decision-making and governance that harnesses self-organization and facilitates rapid adaptation to change. Sociocracy fills a gap in most Agile methods, by adding an agile decision making process and management structure that values self-organization and integrates with agile software development processes. Sociocracy adds significant value when applied on a single agile team, and its fractal structure can integrate agile decision-making and leadership across multiple teams, a large department, or an entire company. Attendees will leave with an understanding of the benefits and practices of Sociocracy, as well as hands-on experience applying the model to enhance agility, improve decision-making, and more easily integrate feedback into decisions, processes, and practices.

12875	Agile Project Initiation Techniques - The Inception Deck and Boot Camp	Expecting new teams to pick up and apply Agile software development practices without any training or guidance is unrealistic. Just as an army wouldn't send its soldiers to battle without basic training, nor should we begin Agile projects under similar circumstances. If team members new to Agile become frustrated and struggle while trying to learn how to apply the techniques, there is a risk they will revert back into their old bad habits. All Agile projects should begin with a boot camp. Boot camps help teams gel, decide on a code of conduct, and set expectations appropriately. Teams that use boot camps also have less internal conflict, apply the Agile practices at a higher level, and experience greater productivity.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12876	A Self Funding Agile Transformation	How can a developer bring about change within their team. How can a development team influence the processes outside their direct control? A consultant will tell you to hire a consultant or go on an immersion course. But Big-Up-Front-Training doesn't seem to be in the spirit of agile. What is more, having to get authorization and capital investment up front in order to act is counter to Kaizen principles. An alternative is to bootstrapped agile practices using your own people. Then pay for further improvement by using funds freed from efficiency savings generated by Agile. This experience report will describe the benefits and drawbacks of a DIY agile implementation, and what kind of time-line you can expect. We will also explain how the developers sold agile to management and the rest of the company. We want to motivate other individuals and teams to act independently and find ways of moving forward in their own organizations, with or without the help of external consultants.

12877	Embedded Agile Project by the Numbers With Newbies	This session will present detailed metrics from a three year long agile project where a newly formed development team produced a new spectrometer product from scratch. The team experimented with various agile practices while recording data on bug rates, bug root causes, code size, schedule compliance, and labor expended. What makes this project even more unusual is that most of the team members lacked important technical skills for this work but they outperformed far more experienced teams. The natural learning environment and safety net that Agile provides allowed them to learn fast while keeping them from serious mistakes.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12878	Workshop: Teaching Agile -- Agile Teaching: Creating an Holistic Learning Environment	Teaching and learning agile principles and practices is more than teaching pair programming and test-driven development, yet that is typically where the focus lies in programming and software engineering courses. We want to consider the challenges and opportunities for creating a holistic teaching-learning environment for agile principles and practices: * When to introduce agile into the curriculum (learning experience) - at beginning (perhaps coordinated with OO) or later after they have had some "traditional" software development education o Where in the curriculum - put in a single course or distribute throughout program. * Which methodologies to introduce and use - does it matter - XP, scrum, etc. * Agile think first, then agile software development? What is best way to instill the principles? * Apply agile approach to teaching - don't teach it all in one lump. * How to teach (transfer) experience? Students and faculty come with different levels of experience in software development. How to capitalize on this diversity of skill, experience and interest? * How should traditionally educated faculty get the required skills? * Team teaching team learning - building the community. * Text and materials * Retrospectives * Agile development projects - infrastructure, platform, programming language(s), open source o Games, tools, techniques	Main	Talk	2006

12880	The Test-Driven Development Pairing Game: Making Pairing Fun	The Test-Driven Development (TDD) Pairing Game is a fun approach for introducing software engineers to TDD and pair-programming. The structure of the game encourages a higher level of pair-wise collaboration when compared to traditional pairing. The foundation of the game allows the pair to improve upon the TDD experience by creating an environment in which the two developers compete, in a fun way, to write better tests and better code. In the end, the winner is the customer. What results is always a mystery, but one thing is for sure, the collaboration between the pair encourages a careful negotiation of the scope as both the tests and the implementation are created. In the end, this results in higher quality software and a more collaborative experience when compared with traditional approaches. Use this game to introduce test-driven development and pair programming to your organization. Keep using the game to keep the team engaged and excited to come to work.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2006

In this presentation, we will discuss some of the challenges we faced in bringing in DSDM to OCLC, Dublin , Ohio. Founded in 1967, OCLC Online Computer Library Center is a nonprofit, membership, computer library service and research organization dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information and reducing information costs. We will concentrate on how we were able to incorporate DSDM into a development culture that was deeply-routed in "traditional" software development methods. We will use examples from multiple projects to illustrate how DSDM helped OCLC change its culture. We will give an example of the current development cycle and show how OCLC's TLC dashboard is used to track the effectiveness of the development cycle, showing metrics back to 2003	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2006
12883	Using An Agile Approach To Free The Organization From "R&D Paralysis"	This experience report describes how an agile development methodology approach was used to sell a major R&D undertaking within a Swedish technology organization dominated by traditional waterfall projects. By offering management the combination of early and continuous delivery of value and the possibility to change their minds along the way, it became possible to get past the problems of a prohibitively large price tag and too long time to market. The report deals with the entire life cycle of the project, including the initial sales pitch, team setup, challenges related to introducing agile development and project execution. Conclusions include that selling agile methodology takes time, needs to be an ongoing activity within an organization, and that it may actually be easier to convince higher management than developers of the virtues of agility.

12884	Extreme Selling in the Early Stage Space	Agile Development may be used as an effective software development methodology as well as a marketing differentiator. Ternary Software has implemented a two-tiered marketing strategy in the early stage space, with Agile Development at the hub. At one level, Ternary attracts early stage entrepreneurs with the adaptability of the development process, and ability to get to market quickly. At a second level, Ternary appeals to supporting organizations, such as angel investors and law firms with emerging stage practices with the risk minimization inherent in an Agile Process. The two tiers intersect. Not only do the supporting organizations provide exposure to Ternary Software, but they also provide valuable investment dollars to the early stage firms who embrace agile development.

12887	Expressing Business Rules	Learn how to express business rules as Customer tests, with a focus on \r\nexpressing the business domain with clarity and brevity.\r\n\r\nWriting Customer tests is usually complicated by several factors: The \r\nbusiness domain needs to be understood, and usually needs to be \r\nclarified. Tests need to evolve to help this understanding evolve. \r\nEmphasis is often placed too early on the testing aspects, rather than \r\non expressing the business domain as clearly as possible. The tests \r\noften make premature commitments to details of the application being \r\ndeveloped, or are not written until those details are known.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will give you experience in expressing business rules well \r\nas Customer tests (storytests) through small group exercises. We'll see \r\nthat such storytests evolve as the whole team's understanding of the \r\nbusiness needs and the system evolve, creating a ubiquitous language for \r\ndiscussing the domain.

In \r\n    contrast, many Agile projects not incorporating UE approaches suffer \r\n    from delivery of products that, though on-time and of high technical \r\n    quality, poorly address user needs.  \r\n\t\r\n\tIn this tutorial you'll learn the basics of the Agile Development \r\n\tand User Experience lifecycles and how User \r\n\tExperience work can function cohesively within Agile Development.  \r\n\tYou'll learn that UE refers to much \r\n\tmore than user interface design and, in fact, encompasses a number of \r\n\ttechniques that give guidance on \r\n\tproject scoping and user interface validation.  Through participation \r\n\tyou'll learn lightweight collaborative \r\n\tvariations of UE techniques such as user role modeling, task modeling, \r\n\tand user interface prototyping.  Using\r\n\t these models and UI prototypes you'll write user stories that \r\n\t incrementally release your product design.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12889	In Retrospect: Mining the Wisdom of Agile Projects	"Experience is not \r\n    what happens to a man; it is what a man \r\n    does with what happens to him." A. Huxley. \r\n\t\r\n\tThe same is true for software teams. Too often, we don't do much - if \r\n\tanything - to squeeze learning out of \r\n\texperience.  Retrospectives are a way to take "what happens" during a \r\n\tsoftware development project and use\r\n\t it to build understanding and capability. \r\n\tThis team learning process is an integral part of every Agile method. \r\n\tRetrospectives happen at the end of an\r\n\t iteration, release, and project.  This interactive session will teach \r\n\t ScrumMasters, XP Coaches and other \r\n\tAgile team members the nuts and bolts of facilitating effective \r\n\tretrospectives.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12890	The Release Planning Game	This course will use the release planning game to explore various project \r\n    planning strategies. The game is played in small groups of approximately \r\n    four players. Both programmers and customers may play, in any combination.\r\n    In each cycle of the game, the players plan and "implement" a product. \r\n    Each time through, they learn some new lessons enabling them to plan and \r\n    implement better next time. Scoring is based upon each team's total return \r\n    on investment.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12891	Agile Product Owner and Customer Boot Camp	Requirements management has always been identified as a key element of \r\n\r\nany successful development process, and in agile processes, a solid \r\n\r\npipeline of well-conceived requirements is no less crucial. In agile \r\n\r\nprocesses, requirements management is performed by a role typically \r\n\r\ncalled the Product Owner or Customer, through mechanisms such as the \r\n\r\nProduct Backlog, Stories and Release Plans. While an increasing body \r\n\r\nof writings is forming around these topics, many agile processes focus \r\n\r\nprimarily on development, making practical guidance and training in \r\n\r\nadvanced agile requirements management practices much harder to find.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this intensive, hands-on tutorial, you will gain direct experience \r\n\r\nwith a wide range of agile requirements management practices drawn from \r\n\r\nScrum, Extreme Programming, DSDM and more. Through a series of \r\n\r\nprogressive exercises simulating an actual project lifecycle, tutorial \r\n\r\nparticipants will have the opportunity to learn and evaluate agile \r\n\r\nstrategies and practices to introduce and apply to their projects. This \r\n\r\nis a participation-based tutorial, so prepare yourself to be actively \r\n\r\nengaged in real world project scenarios, including:\r\n\r\nAligning agile projects with business objectives and initiatives.\r\n\r\nSetting project goals using agile chartering and business cases.\r\n\r\nTechniques for handling multi-stakeholder constituencies.\r\n\r\nCapturing product requirements using agile use cases.\r\n\r\nPractices for creating effective backlog items, stories and release plans.\r\n\r\nEvaluating product progress using the feedback mechanisms of agile processes.\r\n\r\nManaging a product portfolio using agile earned value approaches.

12892	Test Driven Development for Embedded Systems	TDD frameworks for OO languages are available, but that leaves many \r\n    embedded developers out because \r\n\tthey're working in C or assembler. In this workshop, participants will \r\n\tdevelop a small application using Test \r\n\tDriven Development techniques. They will start with an existing code \r\n\tframework written in C. The application\r\n\t will be expanded in-class on a Linux host system using Open Source \r\n\t tools and a commercially available \r\n\tARM embedded development board. You'll learn from software engineers \r\n\twho have used these techniques \r\n\tto deliver real projects on time.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe format will be a single hardware setup, with code visible on a \r\n\tprojector. \r\n\tOne pair of attendees at a time will develop and test code while the \r\n\tothers watch and discuss what is happening.

12893	The 59-Minute Scrum : Bringing Scrum Alive!	Scrum relies heavily on practices around time boxing, collaboration, \r\n    product owner, product backlog, demo, and review. But how do we help \r\n    teams new to Scrum quickly grasp these concepts? We created \r\n    "The 59-minute Scrum" in 2004 in order to help participants really \r\n    experience how these Scrum practices feel. Since then it has been \r\n    delivered successfully over 20 times world-wide by a variety of Scrum \r\n    trainers and has even become part of the Certified Scrum Master \r\n    training.  Because we've received so many inquiries about the \r\n    simulation, we are offering this tutorial that describes the \r\n    simulation, its purpose, its logistics, its materials, and its \r\n    facilitation. We will then lead the group in a running of the \r\n    simulation and then a detailed debrief on the overall experience.  \r\n    Participants will receive a full packet of materials for delivering the \r\n    simulation.

12894	How To Maximize The Value of Software Assets	Simplistic approaches to technical product management lead product \r\n    managers to believe that business \r\n\tdecisions such as pricing or business models can be made independently \r\n\tof underlying technologies. \r\n\tSimilarly, simplistic approaches to product engineering lead technical \r\n\tleaders to believe that technical \r\n\tdecisions, such as the choice of implementation technology or \r\n\tperformance, can be made independently of \r\n\tcontextual business issues. Mature approaches to maximizing software \r\n\trelated product and service profits \r\n\trecognize that business and technology issues are inter-twined in a \r\n\tcomplex system.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis dynamic is even more complex in the context of agile project \r\n\tmanagement, where value propositions \r\n\tare fluid and release dates negotiatiable. \r\n\t\r\n\tThis tutorial introduces participants to the Enthiosys Profit Engine \r\n\tFramework, which is the first framework that\r\n\t helps business and technical leaders sort through the core issues \r\n\t required for maximizing profit in software \r\n\trelated product and service offerings. \r\n\t\r\n\tUpon completing this tutorial participants will understand the \r\n\tfollowing models and how they can be applied\r\n\t to maximize profits:\r\n\t - Customer Value Model: Identifies and Captures Value\r\n\t- Business Model: The Way You Make Money\r\n\t - Pricing Model: How Much Money You Make\r\n\t - Customer ROI Model: Quantifies Customer Value\r\n\t - Licensing Model: Terms and Conditions of Use\r\n\t - Enforcement Model: Protection of Rights\r\n\t - Profit Engine: Causes More Money Making - or more Profitable -- \r\n\t Events	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12895	Management Issues for Lean Software Development: Management Imperatives for the Successful Implementation of Lean Software	Many attempts to implement agile software development practices end in \r\n    failure. Why? Because these \r\n\tpractices change the way the entire organization must relate to the \r\n\tsoftware development process.  When \r\n\tthey are implemented without participation from the rest of the \r\n\torganization, the chance of success is greatly\r\n\t decreased.  \r\n\tLean software development requires deep and evolving customer \r\n\tunderstanding, strategic prioritization of \r\n\tdevelopment activities, a development pipeline that is balanced against \r\n\tdevelopment capacity, and \r\n\tleadership that provides both technical guidance and domain expertise.

12896	Agile Testing for "Traditional" Testers and Agile Team Members	This tutorial is about the things you need to know about testing in \r\n    agile projects. It will discuss the inside \r\n\tproject position a tester takes, and the skills, techniques \r\n\tand attitude he needs to do that at a professional \r\n\tlevel. The session is aimed at "both sides of the fence"; that \r\n\tis for agile developers and customers who want \r\n\tto work on their testing skills, as well for traditional testers \r\n\twho want to work at their agile skills. Traditional \r\n\ttesters will learn about the "mindset" that helps them be effective \r\n\tin an agile project. Other agile team \r\n\tmembers will learn to think like a tester, that is:  problem \r\n\tcreating instead of problem solving.  One way to \r\n\tdescribe a tester is "someone who habitually questions accepted \r\n\tbeliefs".  No matter what your background,\r\n\tthis tutorial will teach you testing techniques that provide your \r\n\tteam with rapid feedback.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12897	Advanced Feature Estimation and Project Planning	Agile projects use feature estimation and project planning to deliver \r\n    software on time.  \r\n    This course will take the participants through the skills needed to \r\n    estimate and plan project at three levels:\r\n\t\r\n\t1) estimating each feature and creating a plan to deliver all the \r\n\tfeatures\r\n\t2) steering the project to deliver the most value by a specified \r\n\tdate\r\n\t3) explore and refine proposed features so you can fill all needs \r\n\tby a specified date\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe tutorial uses realistic exercises, interspersed with insightful \r\n\tinstructor-led discussion.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe tutorial is appropriate for customers, coaches, and development\r\n\tteam members who will be taking part in and leading Feature Estimation \r\n\tand Project Planning.

12898	Agile Software Development in the Large	A lot of people still believe that agile software development \r\n    is for small teams only. However, the agile value system and the \r\n    principles behind as stated in the agile manifesto don't say anything \r\n    about team or project size. Furthermore the projects I'm working on are \r\n    typicallylarge and mission-critical. Therefore, several years ago I \r\n    took the challenge and tried agile software development in the large. \r\n    Meanwhile I made the similar experience on many large projects: Also \r\n    large teams can benefit from a value system that is beneficial for \r\n    small teams.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial I want to show how to scale agile processes to teams of \r\n200. In fact, the same techniques are also relevant to teams of ten or more \r\ndevelopers, especially within large organizations.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n - the agile value system as used in large teams\r\n - the impact of a switch to agile processes\r\n - the agile coordination of several subteams\r\n - the way project size and team size influence the\r\n   underlying architecture	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12899	Skills for the Agile Designer	Agile designers see the essence of a design problem, shape reasonable \r\n   solutions, and easily communicate their design to others. And when \r\n   things don't exactly go according to plan, they react, readjust their \r\n   thinking, and try again. To pull this off, agile designers need to be \r\n   skillful problem solvers and good communicators (and no, that doesn't \r\n   mean just writing clean code or producing barely enough UML). This \r\n   tutorial introduces several new and perhaps some old and familiar \r\n   techniques and language for seeing and articulating design problems, \r\n   shaping solutions, and explaining designs. We'll touch on strategies for \r\n   finding and characterizing objects and their behavior, designing \r\n   application control centers, adapting patterns into your design, and \r\n   making collaborations more reliable.\r\nRecognizing and adapting to different design rhythms is another key to \r\nagility. By sorting design problems into the core, the revealing, and the \r\nrest, you can treat each appropriately, rather than giving them uniform \r\ntreatment. Even so, problems crop up that cannot be anticipated-wicked \r\nproblems that can't be solved by sheer effort alone. They require a blend \r\nof skills: creative problem solving, negotiation, the ability to \r\ncraft-try-rethink-and-propose solutions that combine simpler ideas or \r\npossibly take a leap in a totally new direction. This tutorial gives agile \r\ndesigners some language to describe and characterize their design problems \r\nand solutions.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12900	Release and Iteration Planning for Agile Projects	Planning is important even for projects using agile processes such as \r\n    XP, Scrum, or Feature-Driven Development. Unfortunately, we've all seen \r\n    so many worthless plans that we'd like to throw planning out altogether. \r\n    The good news is that it is possible to create a project plan that looks \r\n    forward six to nine months that can be accurate and useful. In this \r\n    tutorial we will look at why traditional plans fail but why planning is \r\n    still necessary even on agile projects. You will leave with a solid \r\n    understanding of and experience at agile release planning and iteration \r\n    planning. We will look at various approaches to estimating including \r\n    unit-less points and ideal time. The tutorial will describe four \r\n    techniques for deriving estimates as well as when and how to re-estimate. \r\n    We will look at techniques to create a plan that dramatically improves \r\n    the project's chances of on-time completion. Also discussed will be \r\n    using velocity to track progress against the plan.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005

It allows key issues \r\n    related to automated acceptance testing to be raised in a natural \r\n    environment	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12902	Collaboration Works! Facilitation Skills for Agile Teams	Collaboration happens when all members of a group or team share a \r\n    common purpose, mutual trust and use agreed-upon approaches for their \r\n    work. A well-tuned team operates like a jazz ensemble-multiple voices \r\n    playing inventively, generously and skillfully while sharing a single \r\n    theme. This doesn't just happen. Teams don't just form and jell \r\n    automatically. How, then, can you encourage real collaboration? \r\nFacilitation skills are crucial for agile teams, which must experience \r\nhealthy team dynamics in order to continually learn and adapt. In mature \r\nteams, effective facilitation skills can emerge spontaneously and become \r\nshared amongst team member. How is this accomplished? What specific \r\ntechniques can you use to promote collaboration?  \r\n\r\nThis experience-based tutorial will share a set of effective facilitation \r\nskills and collaboration patterns that will help you and your team to truly \r\ncollaborate better. You will be provided with a rich set of handouts \r\ncontaining specific techniques you can use to promote real team \r\ncollaboration. In this tutorial, be prepared to enjoy recognizing, \r\ncelebrating and appreciating collaboration-because collaboration works!	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12903	Test-Driven J2EE	J2EE applications are complicated, and we're generally pretty bad at \r\ntesting the various parts of them effectively. We tend to rely on end-to-end \r\ntests that are slow, cumbersome and brittle. True, a 4-hour test suite is \r\nbetter than a 3-week manual testing cycle, but we can do so much better. \r\nThis tutorial shows attendees how to add a feature to a J2EE application, \r\nentirely in the test-driven style. It highlights test execution speed \r\ndifferences, as well as the impact of test-driving on design.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12904	The Whole Enchilada: Effectively Blending Management, Planning & Technical Practices.	While many agile processes excel at management, planning or technical \r\npractices, most don't deliver a complete solution: a process that specifies \r\nhow an entire enterprise can become truly agile.  Partial solutions often \r\nfail to include key parties in agile transitions.  For example, if product \r\nmanagement fails to go agile, you won't deliver valuable software early, if \r\nlegal fails to go agile, you won't get expedient feedback on your iterations, \r\nif you HR rewards cowboy coders, you won't see a lot of teamwork.  In other \r\nwords, the most agile software development team won't provide genuine value \r\nif agility has not penetrated the entire enterprise. \r\nThis interactive tutorial is based on dozens of agile transitions. You'll \r\nlearn how Readiness Assessments prepare the ground for success, how \r\nChartering helps define key parties and interactions within a Project \r\nCommunity,  how Storytest-Driven Development aligns, defines and verifies \r\nthe work of customers and developers, and how Evolutionary Design and \r\nDelivery helps yield faster ROI.  Participants in this tutorial can expect \r\nto come away with ample ideas for how to use these practices to aid them in \r\nsuccessfully blending agile management, planning and technical practices to \r\ncreate a truly agile enterprise.

12905	Introducing agile practices to your team or organization	Those who attend conferences or read articles see new ideas they want to \r\ntake back to their organizations, but then struggle to make it happen. \r\nThis struggle has become especially apparent of late as enthusiastic agile \r\ndevelopment proponents want to encourage their teams to apply these new \r\napproaches.  The intent of this tutorial is to provide successful change \r\nmanagement strategies to help these agile proponents.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12906	Hands-on Teaching Agile Programming	As a software team leader, how many times did you ask yourself: \r\nHow shall I convey the magnificent ideas of the agile approach to my team? \r\nAs a university professor, how many times did you try to introduce a new \r\nteaching approach to your institution? This tutorial aims at helping you \r\nachieving these goals, specifically, introducing new ideas related to \r\nsoftware development into your organization, whether it is an academic \r\ninstitution or a software house. This tutorial is based on our rich \r\nexperience in teaching agile methods and practices in different settings \r\nin the industry, the army and the academia, as well as our vast experience \r\nin guiding the implementation them in such organizations. We focus on \r\nhands-on teaching and learning agile practices to enable our participants \r\nto run these processes by themselves. The tutorial consists of three parts: \r\nthe teaching of agile practices in the industry, the teaching of agile \r\npractices in the academia and the guidance of reflective processes.

12907	A Project Manager's Survival Guide to Going Agile	When software development project teams move to Agile\r\n methodologies, they often leave project managers\r\n behind.  Traditionally trained project managers are\r\n confused as to what their new roles and\r\n responsibilities should be in an environment that no\r\n longer needs them to make stand-alone decisions.  \r\n This tutorial focuses on re-defining the job of\r\n project manager, and the new duties of the program\r\n management office.  Special emphasis is placed on\r\n the\r\n shift to servant leadership, with its focus on\r\n facilitation and collaboration.  Attendees should\r\n leave not only with a better understanding of what\r\n changes they need to make professionally, but also\r\n with clear guidance as to how to make these changes\r\n and achieve their goals.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12908	Storytest-Driven Development	Falling behind on writing your acceptance tests? This is a common problem. \r\nEither you don't have the right people to produce acceptance tests and/or \r\nyou just never seem to have enough time to implement them. The result is a \r\nbacklog of work and not enough coverage for the features in your system. \r\nThe solution to this problem is called Storytest-Driven Development (SDD). \r\nThis practice advocates that you define storytests (automated acceptance \r\ncriteria) for stories prior to implementing them. Writing the storytest \r\nfirst aids both developers and customers in aligning their efforts. \r\nStorytests are textual descriptions of a test that are easy to read, modify \r\nand execute. Subject matter experts, analysts, testers and programmers \r\nproduce these tests collaboratively. Storytests may be automated using a \r\nvariety of technologies, such as FIT, Ward Cunngingham's excellent Framework \r\nfor Integrated Test. A key benefit of this practice is the design simplicity \r\nthat flows out of starting all work with a failing storytest. This class \r\nwill introduce you to the practice of SDD. We'll explore example code and \r\ndiscuss real-world applications of this practice, then we'll apply Storytest \r\nDriven Development, using FIT for Java and .Net(C#).  We'll also discuss \r\nstrategies for writing Storytests on 'hard to test applications'. \r\nThis tutorial will involve hands-on SDD in pairs, so please bring a \r\nlaptop if you have one.

12909	Software Metrics for Agile Projects	Metrics are often associated with bureaucratic and prescriptive processes. \r\nThis tutorial will teach how to gather and analyze key metrics in a manner \r\nthat fits well with agile processes.  Attendees will learn how to use these \r\nmetrics to help identify and rank risk hotspots in large and/or unfamiliar \r\ncode bases.  The audience will apply these techniques to several large open \r\nsource projects.  While the techniques taught are applicable to many \r\ntechnologies, the tools taught and projects analyzed will be based on Java.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12910	Refactoring: keeping software malleable	Most software gets new requirements over time. The accumulated changes \r\noften stress the original design in unanticipated ways. When this happens, \r\nthe software gets more and more difficult to work with: development tasks \r\nget harder, progress slows and bugs appear ever more quickly.\r\nHave you worked on a system like this?\r\nSometimes it becomes so difficult to add new functionality or prevent \r\nbugs creeping in that it seems easier to give up and rewrite the system \r\nfrom scratch. This can be avoided by refactoring.\r\nRefactoring breathes new life into software by changing the way it is \r\nwritten without changing what it does, keeping it malleable and ready to \r\naccept change. Refactoring allows you to remould code with the design it \r\nshould have, rather than the design it ended up with. Done right, it works \r\nin small, easy steps, and doesn't require a big up-front investment.\r\nThis tutorial introduces and explains refactoring in a hands-on way. We'll \r\nhelp you learn to spot "smells" in the code and design, and we'll show you \r\nwhat you can do about them.\t\r\nThe tutorial is based on a simple problem from a real system, and at the \r\nend we'll tell you what really happened!

12911	Meeting the Agile Leadership Challenge	Many leaders facing the challenge of adapting to their role on agile \r\nprojects find methods from the field of organizational development methods \r\nespecially useful. This tutorial covers how several of the most successful \r\nof these methods work and how each assists the agile process. Strategies to \r\nimplement these tools will be discussed and practiced.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12912	How to integrate a Test/QA Team into an Agile Development Environment	When we think agile testing, we generally think embedded tester working \r\nclosely with the development and customer team helping to identify \r\nacceptance tests, sometimes coding, sometimes using a tool such as FIT.  \r\nHowever, there are cases where a test team needs to have some independence. \r\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how your test / QA team can work closely with \r\nthe development team yet maintain their individuality.\r\nLarge systems require full system regression testing, deployment testing, \r\nload testing, etc., in an environment that is similar to a customer's site. \r\nMultiple versions of a product require testing and support. When people \r\nthink about agile projects, they usually think about small projects that a \r\nsingle tester or two can work with the developers and complete all the \r\ntesting needed.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12913	How does Incremental Design Really Work?	Agile Methodologies push teams and individuals to alter the balance\r\nbetween up-front and incremental design.  Being able to evolve the\r\ndesign and architecture of a system as the code is written is an\r\nessential skill in agile software development, yet many programmers\r\nstill struggle to understand how this works in practice.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will teach you the skills necessary to be successful\r\nwith incremental design.  You will learn how to do "just enough"\r\ndesign at each step of the process.  You will appreciate how working\r\nin small increments with immediate feedback from the code improves\r\nyour ability to design robust, well-factored, maintainable software.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the time will be devoted to an extended example.\r\nParticipants will practice the technique of incremental design on a\r\nmedium-sized, real-world business problem for which the solution is\r\nnot obvious.  Through an interactive demo, you will observe and\r\nexperience how the simplest and best design emerges--even with no\r\nexplicit up-front work.  Finally, the philosophy and practical\r\napplication of incremental design to large systems will be discussed.\r\nJust how little up-front design can we be successful with, both\r\neconomically and technically?  Seeing is believing--come and learn how\r\nto add this valuable skill to your developer's toolbox.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12914	Stop super-sizing your release plans! Helping product owners switch to regular, bite-sized iterations.	Product owners - the analysts, product managers and project leads \r\nresponsible for defining the system requirements and business priorities - \r\nincreasingly force their development teams into super-sizing their release \r\nplans.  More features coupled with less priorities and less time lead to \r\n"over eating" when it comes to defining the goals for software releases.  \r\nThe result is software that too-often arrives late, over budget and misses \r\ncustomer expectations. \r\nAs Agile development teams gain success, the team's bottleneck moves up \r\nthe food chain to product owners.  To support rapid and iterative progress, \r\ndevelopment teams are demanding that product owners switch from traditional \r\napproaches of super-sizing long release cycles to a continuous flow of \r\nindependent, negotiable and small, bite-sized morsels.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Ryan Martens and Luke Hohmann will describe and show \r\nproduct owners how to think in terms of small, evenly spaced meals.  They \r\nwill introduce Agile principles, processes, tools and organizational \r\nstructures that enable product owners to support their Agile development \r\nteam's need for continuous, just-in-time elaboration of requirements and \r\nacceptance tests.  Through his own consulting experiences, and leading \r\nteams at U S WEST, Avitek and later BEA Systems, Martens has developed \r\nproven steps that transform the requirements management process into a \r\ncollaborative effort that helps drive the success of the entire Agile \r\npractice internally and for customers as well. \r\n\r\nLuke Hohmann, will work with Martens to help teams understand how to \r\nwork creatively through the common answer, "it can't be done!"  The duo \r\nwill coordinate and facilitate one of Enthiosys' 12-ways exercises called \r\n"Pruning the Product Tree" to help teams creatively break the log jam \r\nassociated with super-sized requirements management.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn:\r\n\r\n* How to package and prioritize features to accelerate development.  \r\n(An exercise on design continuums and how to drive quickly to acceptance \r\ntests will help attendees gain skills in feeding Agile development teams.)\r\n* How to use the rapid iteration and release process of Agile \r\ndevelopment to help break large requirements into smaller more easily \r\nimplemented designs and solutions. (Enthiosys' Pruning the Product Tree \r\nexercise will provide attendees with one technique to help find creative \r\nsolutions to super-sized requirement jams.)	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12915	Evolutionary Database Development	Evolving the database at the speed of application development is thought to \r\nbe very hard. This tutorial will show, when the team is doing Evolutionary \r\nDatabase Development, rapid database changes are easy to make.\r\nThe common belief that database design cannot be carried out using agile \r\nmethodologies such as XP, coupled with the inbuilt 'conservatism' of DBAs, \r\noften leads application developers to try to 'cut out' the DBA or reduce \r\ntheir interactions with the database team.\r\n\r\nParticipants will be shown how the design, development and \r\nimplementation of an application database could be made agile starting with \r\nmaking the DBA a true member of the team. Pramod will explain, in detail, \r\nhow processes and tools can be used to make the database more manageable \r\nand open to refactoring, both in development and production environments. \r\nThe workshop will focus on practical techniques that have been proven to \r\nachieve this on small and large-scale projects, techniques that can be \r\ntaken and applied to your projects, including:\r\n\r\n*How the database could be structured to provide each team member with \r\ncontrol of their own data space (similar to individual application instances).\r\n*How ANT/MAVEN build scripts can be used to make setup and tear down of\r\n databases a trivial task.\r\n*How to adopt a system where changes to the database can take place \r\neasily.\r\n*How to handle the change management process.\r\n*How migrating to production can be made easy with sequenced script \r\nfiles thus making the process of managing and releasing easy.\r\n\r\nUsing these techniques your development team can be far more confident \r\nabout adapting the application during development, knowing that changes and \r\nalterations will be properly documented, the changes and modifications are \r\nscripted and repeatable, and each change is backed-up by a suite of \r\nautomated tests that ensures the application builds and that the \r\napplication and database are consistent after each build. This level of \r\nconfidence is then sustained right through to production by leveraging the \r\nrepeatability of the changes and modifications.\r\n\r\nPramod will show why the DBA will be far happier to evolve the data \r\nmodel during the development process in step with the agile approach used \r\nto build the rest of the application. How the DBA can be a true member of \r\nthe team and make the agile team more productive\r\n\r\nRecent Presentations and Publications:\r\n\r\nXPAU, Aug 2002, Aug 2004\r\nEvolutionary Database Design (with Martin Fowler), Dec 2002.\r\nSD West, March 2002, March 2003\r\nXP Day Benelux Nov 2004	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12916	Working Effectively with Legacy Code	Test Driven Development and Refactoring are powerful tools in the XP/Agile \r\narsenal. With them you can add new code to systems and make existing code \r\nmore maintainable. However, refactoring code without having tests in place \r\ncan be hazardous. This tutorial presents a collection of dependency \r\nbreaking and test writing techniques that can be used to get existing code \r\nsafely under test for refactoring. These techniques can be used in \r\nconjunction with Test Driven Development to breathe new life into large \r\nexisting code bases.	Tutorials	Tutorial	2005
12917	Is Your Organization Ready for Agile and Scrum?	Agile software development sounds really good. Higher productivity, better \r\nreturn on investment, quicker delivery of software, motivated and energetic \r\ndevelopers are all appealing. Are you willing and able to do what is \r\nrequired to get these benefits? Some people think all you have to do is \r\nread books, take courses, and then implement Agile. But the work is much \r\ndeeper and harder and has many aspects of organizational change management. \r\nThis tutorial will help you understand how to implement Agile enterprise-wide \r\nand whether your organization has the aptitude for it.

12918	Agile Development of the Database: A Focal Entity Prototyping Approach	The agile development of the database and the application system is a \r\n    highly productive and successful activity when undertaken in a coherent \r\n    and organized manner. Agility does not preclude structure and order in \r\n    development. The more serial thinking that the entire database schema \r\n    must be developed once and for all, and before any processing \r\n    development can take place, is seen to be incorrect and unnecessary. \r\n    The evolution of the database, like other aspects of evolutionary and \r\n    agile development of software systems, contributes significantly to \r\n    schema quality, correctness and adaptability.  \r\n\r\n    This paper draws upon 20 years of experience in developing database \r\n    systems in an agile, evolutionary manner, and suggests and elaborates \r\n    upon a well ordered and well-organized, but clearly agile approach, to \r\n    database development, which the author has termed "Focal Entity \r\n    Prototyping". This technique takes a domain/conceptual modeling \r\n    approach supported by user interface prototyping which then drives \r\n    development.  Research and experience in both commercial development \r\n    and in an academic project environment has demonstrated the \r\n    reasonableness and efficacy of this approach.

12919	Teaching a Goliath to Fly Applying agile methodologies in a large legacy codebase	When Primavera Systems decided to adopt agile methodologies for the \r\n\tdevelopment of their Project management suite, no one expected it to be \r\n\teasy. There were about 1.5 M lines of legacy code, in Delphi and Java, \r\n\tseveral applications, tight release cycles, high demand from marketing \r\n\tfor new features. This paper describes from a software-architecture \r\n\tperspective, the transformation of a largely waterfall-based development \r\n\tstrategy into an agile, test-driven practice.. It looks at the \r\n\tobstacles and difficulties we faced during this change, the way we \r\n\tapproached refactoring legacy code to make it testable. It also looks \r\n\tat the process of creating a Business Object Framework in an \r\n\tevolutionary way to support our test driven development.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2005
12920	Challenges of Delivering APIs in an Agile Context	"Platform" technology \r\n    should be stable, and the APIs that express them are normally expected \r\n    to be un-responsive to change. But in a rapidly changing domain \r\n    (biotechnology) in a churning business environment, the challenges of \r\n    providing useful, well-designed APIs rapidly mount. How often will \r\n    other teams pick up new versions of libraries? How do you manage rapid \r\n    database schema evolution? How does a business organization get \r\n    significant code reuse when the concepts are changing rapidly, \r\n    harvesting common features from the work of teams using the APIs? \r\n    What are the Really Big Mistakes that this team made that others in \r\n    the same situation could avoid? Encounters with Big Design Up Front are \r\n    described, as well as successes with incremental delivery to projects \r\n    taking frequent releases of the APIs. Team management issues and \r\n    testing challenges are also discussed, with a few figures about \r\n    number of automated tests, KLOC and code coverage provided.

12921	Promiscuous Pairing and Beginner's Mind: Embrace Inexperience	On an 18-month project that grew from 3 to 11 people, team members \r\n    conducted many experiments with task ownership, pair swap frequency, \r\n    and task assignment methods.\r\n    We experimented with the optimal time between pair swaps. We \r\n    conducted a dozen week-long experiments in which we required pairs to \r\n    switch at specific times, ranging from 30 minutes to one week. We also \r\n    experimented with swapping at will, or on task completion. We found \r\n    that fixed 90 minute swaps had the best impact on our velocity.\r\n\r\n    We also experimented with varying levels of task ownership. We \r\n    gathered a half-dozen data points as follows. One data point was \r\n    completely ad-hoc; every time that a pair formed, it would take an \r\n    arbitrary task from the board. Another point was individual ownership; \r\n    each person owned a set of tasks for the week, and would pick one or \r\n    more sequential partners with whom to work on them. The remainder of \r\n    the points were station-owned tasks; a task would stay at a station, \r\n    and each pair swap would move one partner off the station and leave the \r\n    other. The variance between these points was in the number of swaps for \r\n    which a single person remained. Optimal velocity resulted from \r\n    station-owned tasks with alternating pair swaps.\r\n\r\n    Finally, we tried several methods of task assignment. Here, we \r\n    tested two independent variables. The first variable was pull- or \r\n    push-based task assignment. The second was how to take into account \r\n    knowledge in an area when assigning tasks in that area. The three \r\n    values were to favor local knowledge, disfavor local knowledge, or \r\n    assign randomly. Pull-based assignment disfavoring local knowledge \r\n    resulted in maximal velocity. Additionally, we found that making this \r\n    task assignment the key task for our 2+ daily launch meetings provided \r\n    a clear, concise purpose for those meetings. This kept the meetings at \r\n    less than 5 minutes, even for an 11 person team.\r\n\r\n    Overall, we found this promiscuous pairing to greatly increase the \r\n    flow of information through pair net. In addition to increasing our \r\n    velocity and reducing the number of 15 minute or longer refactorings \r\n    we needed per week, it dramatically decreased our new hire ramp-up \r\n    time. We were able to fully ramp up new hires who had never programmed \r\n    in C++ before - to the level that they could write template \r\n    metaprograms and train the next round of new hires - in one month.

12922	Estimating in actual time	I present a proposal for an experience report that describes my team's \r\n    experiences with an estimation scheme that avoids the confusing notion \r\n    of "ideal" time, uses an appropriate level of granularity for the size \r\n    of the story, and which acknowledges the uncertainty inherent in \r\n    estimation. I will describe the scheme, and then will present what \r\n    we've learned using the scheme, both from a process point of view and \r\n    from an empirical, data mining point of view.

12923	Improving Agile Team Learning by Improving Team Reflections	Many Agile proponents encourage reflection as part of the\r\nfeedback/learning cycle. When we began using Agile practices, including\r\nreflection, I discovered that our organization's norms and beliefs\r\ntended to discount the value of regular reflection meetings. Many\r\nengineers wanted to avoid anything that might be seen as "touchy-feely."\r\nOur initial attempts at holding regular reflection meetings for agile\r\nteams had mixed results. Some reflections turned into gripe sessions\r\nwhere a lot of venting occurred but nothing changed. Other reflections\r\nwere short and a little too sweet - team members said little and no\r\nlearning occurred. This paper describes some of our efforts helping\r\nteams improve their reflection meetings and relates some of the positive\r\nresults in my organization as a result of regular reflection. It also\r\ndiscusses techniques for overcoming initial reluctance to take time out\r\nto reflect, keeping reflection meetings interesting, and taking\r\nreflection to a deeper level.

12924	Introducing Agile Development (XP) into a Corporate Webmaster Environment	In November of 2004, the IBM Corporate Webmaster team deployed a major \r\n    release of their corporate web portal (www.ibm.com).  This effort \r\n    required the updating of over 1.6 million webpages in support of 9 \r\n    countries/languages and required the coordination of hundreds of \r\n    programmers/information architects spanning 4 continents.  While the \r\n    release addressed many facets of the site, including layouts, and style \r\n    changes, new functions were developed, for the first time, using agile \r\n    techniques.  In this paper we present an experience report of our \r\n    development efforts, which utilized extreme programming (XP). \r\n    We will focus on the challenge of moving a large, traditional \r\n    waterfall-driven organization to an agile development methodology.  \r\n    In particular, we address the challenges and value of adhering to the \r\n    full set of XP practices, some of which we found (at times) difficult \r\n    to follow.\r\n\r\n    Among the challenges we faced during the project and that were \r\n    reconfirmed during the project retrospectives were: \r\n    * doing agile development in an organization that interfaces with \r\n    and depends upon non-agile organizational entities\r\n    * meshing agile development cycles with infrastructure changes that \r\n    often happen on different timelines.\r\n    * doing test driven development in an organization that typically \r\n    depends on a separate test and quality assurance teams distributed \r\n    around the world and function according to separate quality assurance \r\n    cycles outside the scope of the development team\r\n    * assessing the need for and effecting education and culture change \r\n    as an important factor in the success of an agile project. \r\n\r\n    Other environmental issues that will be discussed included coping \r\n    with and providing for I/T organizations that require advance \r\n    notification of specifications for the deployment of applications in \r\n    datacenters.  This proved to be especially challenging in an \r\n    environment where a change in the requirements can cause issues with \r\n    application deployment and infrastructure setup such as firewalls and \r\n    secure data communication paths.  \r\n\r\n    Overall we report a positive (although challenging) experience with \r\n    the XP methodology, and we will report on how we plan to modify/augment \r\n    some of the practices and perhaps the environment for future agile \r\n    project development.

12925	Staying agile in Government Software Projects	Can government software projects be agile?  What do Scrum and XP \r\n    practices have to offer in this regulated and highly political \r\n    environment?  In this experience report, we will discuss some of the \r\n    unique challenges in our environment and how we have had to adapt these \r\n    practices to produce commercial-grade software.  First, we will provide \r\n    a "report card" on our progress in applying Scrum & XP practices to a \r\n    clinical data management project over a two year period.  Then, we will \r\n    describe the practices that were accepted "religiously", adapted to get \r\n    the job done, and completely abandoned.  In particular, we will discuss \r\n    how we got around bootstrapping, Rational tools, documentation needs, \r\n    and managing a product backlog for a diverse, decentralized user \r\n    community.  In addition, we found that staying agile is just as hard as \r\n    becoming agile.  Putting agile practices to work, although a challenge, \r\n    resulted in better team communication, more usable system, and improved \r\n    partnership between the users and the development team.

12926	Selling Agile:Target Cost Contracts	Agile approaches make a lot of sense to software developers, but \r\n    selling Agile to business people can be a tricky task, particularly in \r\n    a consulting situation. It is not difficult to get people to appreciate \r\n    the benefits of Agile, but forming an agreement that embraces change is \r\n    not simple. Target-Cost contracts have been suggested as a solution to \r\n    structuring agile projects, but do they work?  This experience report \r\n    describes how we have successfully used them with three different \r\n    clients.  This approach has allowed us to build better client \r\n    relationships by ensuring that contracts empower both the development \r\n    team and the client to work collaboratively to deliver software that \r\n    meets the client's real needs.  We believe these experiences will add \r\n    value to teams working in both a formal consulting environments as well \r\n    as an internal development department.

12927	Community Building: a Critical Success Factor for XP Projects	Extreme Programming (XP) literature and discussions often view \r\n    successful projects only as customer-driven product development: \r\n    planning, coding and testing an unfolding series of prioritized units \r\n    of vertical functionality. I claim, however, that a successful project \r\n    also requires a prospering community, comprising an introspective group \r\n    of committed professionals communicating effectively, and using a \r\n    well-understood, stable process. Weakness on any of these fronts \r\n    presents a high risk of failure; therefore, I advise every XP project's \r\n    members to actively engage in building their community, such that it \r\n    reaches its critical level of development already by the first internal \r\n    release. To help in this endeavor, I provide a comprehensive list of \r\n    activities and attitudes, to practice and avoid, during the first \r\n    release's time.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2005
12928	Using Open Spaces to Resolve Cross Team Issues	Cross-team development issues that need special coordination and close \r\n    attention can be managed successfully by using the Agile concept of \r\n    "Open Spaces".  During our 5.0 development cycle, which is being \r\n    executed by ten teams in 16 sprints, we use open spaces to identify \r\n    and evolve critical cross team issues.  A concept we wished to \r\n    emphasize during this development cycle is that of self managed teams. \r\n    The open space fits very well with that concept.  As with other new \r\n    agile tools, adaptation began slowly, but once developers realized that \r\n    the decision-making power belongs to the open space participants, the \r\n    popularity of this tool increased.

12929	A False Measure of Success	This experience report examines the changes in workflow and processes \r\n    for the web development teams at a major US financial market and the \r\n    results thereof.  The workflow and practices of these web development \r\n    teams, though not perfect, did satisfy the teams' internal business \r\n    customer.  These customers were pleased in the rapid turn-around time \r\n    these technology teams provided.  Any issues or defects that had \r\n    occurred were within acceptable tolerances for the customer's business \r\n    needs.  However, the management teams of the technology division \r\n    mandated implementation of processes to ensure stability, redundancy, \r\n    and uptime.  Employee goals, and financial bonus, were updated to \r\n    measure qualities such as 99.99% uptime, full redundancy and zero \r\n    defects.  As the development teams came closer to their technology \r\n    goals, the cost of running these projects increased and project turn \r\n    around time decreased.  Defining "What quality level is acceptable" \r\n    and "What cost is acceptable" was shifted from the Business teams to \r\n    the Technology teams.  The business customers were no longer pleased \r\n    with the performance of their technology counterparts, thus creating \r\n    A False Measure of Success.

12930	Formalizing Agility: An Agile Organization's Journey toward CMMI Accreditation	Agile methods are quite compatible with formal process improvement \r\n   frameworks. Rather than casting discipline and documentation to the \r\n   wind, agile methods, when seriously applied, are actually very focused \r\n   and comprehensive. Likewise, a framework such as the SEI Capability \r\n   Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI) need not be an overwhelming excess of \r\n   paperwork and bureaucracy; when appropriately implemented, the CMMI \r\n   encourages and enables significant and sustainable improvements.\r\n\r\n    This report describes the ongoing journey of DTE Energy's large IT \r\n    organization in realizing agility and process improvement in a Fortune \r\n    300 corporation. From following waterfall-based approaches to embracing \r\n    agile methods, and from early attempts with the CMM to a renewed \r\n    commitment to continuous improvement by adopting the CMMI, it explores \r\n    cultural and organizational changes that enable real-world process \r\n    improvements.

12931	Stretching Agile to fit CMMI Level 3: the story of creating MSF for CMMI Process Improvement at Microsoft Corporation	Agile practitioners pride themselves on their productivity, their \r\n    agility, the low ceremony, lightweight, tactic knowledge processes \r\n    with no waste, adaptive planning and frequent iterative delivery of \r\n    value. It is often assumed that CMMI compliant process need to be \r\n    heavyweight, bureaucratic, slow moving, high ceremony and plan driven. \r\n    Agile developers perceive formal process improvement initiatives as \r\n    managed generated waste that gets in the way of productivity. At \r\n    Microsoft, we've adopted the teachings of Edwards Deming and stretched \r\n    our MSF for Agile Software Development method to fit the requirements \r\n    for CMMI Level 3. It's a highly iterative, adaptive planning method, \r\n    light on documentation, heavily automated through tooling with \r\n    management and organization enabled through agile metrics such as \r\n    velocity and cumulative flow but with an added dimension of an \r\n    understanding of variation - adapted from Deming's teachings. This is \r\n    the story of how mixing Deming with Agile produced a lightweight CMMI \r\n    solution for .Net developers everywhere.	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2005
12932	Costs of Compliance: Agile in an Inelastic Organization	Doing agile development in an inelastic environment, where policies and \r\n   procedures are virtually unchangeable, creates an impedance mismatch \r\n   between the agile team and its host organization.  Our experience on a \r\n   variety of embedded Java projects has shed some light on the costs of \r\n   complying (or failing to comply) with the policies of the host \r\n   organization.  In keeping with the Agile philosophy, when our efforts \r\n   were failing, we refactored our approach.  We have trialed everything \r\n   from "refusal to comply" to "full compliance".  Regardless of approach, \r\n   there was always an associated cost, such as redrafting documents, \r\n   reducing functionality, spending time in meetings, losing focus on \r\n   deliverables, or deteriorating morale.  In the end, we were faced with \r\n   the questions, "How did we fare?  Which costs were worth bearing? Was it \r\n   all worth it?"	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2005
12933	Agile Phase I The Pragmatic Case Study of Schneider National.	Schneider National began the journey toward Agile development last year.  \r\nAfter doing some research the company sent three representatives to the \r\n2004 conference in Calgary.  Using some of the learnings gathered from the \r\nconference, Schneider began using Agile in a pilot mode.  Schneider's \r\napproach was pragmatic in the sense that it took its current three release \r\na year waterfall process and made changes in an incremental fashion.  The \r\nsteps included getting organizational buyoff for the pilot, forming the \r\npilot team, breaking up a release into three 6-week iterations, \r\nconstructing an open pod area for the group, integrating a offshore \r\n(on-site and remote site) element comprising 50% of the 25 person project \r\nteam, and as of late introducing an offshore testing team strategy.  Why is \r\nthis a neat story?  Because the first project incorporated delivering \r\n17,000 hours+ in a 4.5 month time frame ... ahead of schedule and under \r\nbudget with a substantial offshore component!

12934	Agile Offshore Techniques - A Case Study	The case study will give a brief insight into the different techniques used by \r\n   an Agile project team which was located at two different geographical \r\n   locations. It will demonstrate how the teams used effective tools and \r\n   techniques for collaborating. The case study also talks in detail about team \r\n   dynamics and how the team gelled together as a unit in spite of being \r\n   physically distant. It demonstrates how a flat organization structure can be \r\n   effective rather than a hierarchical structure in using roles rather than \r\n   designations. The case study also shows how the team switched from the \r\n   development to maintenance mode with a different set of techniques which mapped \r\n   sto those used in the development mode.

12935	Follow the Sun: Distributed XP Development	In early 2004, a global company with three independent development \r\n   regions, United States (Seattle), United Kingdom (Poole), and Singapore, \r\n   formed into one 24x5 round-the-clock XP team.   A year after merging \r\n   into one team, the company is effectively using full Extreme Programming \r\n   practices across the world on a single code base.  This experience \r\n   report describes the challenges we face in this environment, lessons \r\n   learned, and how we resolved issues such as global continuous \r\n   integration, cultural differences, and conflicting priorities across \r\n   regions.

12936	Case Study of Customer Input for a Successful Product	Both agile development and User Centered Design stress collaboration between \r\n  customers and product teams, but getting these methodologies to \r\n\r\nwork well together is not easy.   This presentation describes one company's \r\nefforts to merge these processes by creating interconnected \r\nparallel design and development tracks. The benefits of this approach are \r\ndemonstrated by showing how, when and why customer input was \r\nincorporated during the release of a successful software product.\r\nAlias is the world's leading provider of 3D software for design,\r\npresentation will focus on a new product, Alias SketchBook Pro, which was \r\ndeveloped using agile methods including frequent and timely customer input.

12937	Experiences Integrating Sophisticated User Experience Design Practices into Agile Processes	Most significant software processes involve a wide range of disciplines, \r\n   from programming to testing, and from documentation to database development. \r\n   Unfortunately, agile processes are typically presented from the point of view \r\n   of programmers, with the other disciplines often left feeling excluded and \r\n   disenfranchised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   One such discipline is that of user experience design (often abbreviated \r\n   UED or Ux), a discipline encompassing several key specialties including user \r\n   research, interface design, visual design and usability testing. UED \r\n   activities span the full lifecycle of product development from early \r\n   requirements analysis to construction and testing, spanning both large scale \r\n   system issues and detailed components, with its work products forming key \r\n   inputs and deliverables of many development activities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   In this experience report, I discuss my coaching experiences integrating \r\n   sophisticated UED practices into the agile process initiatives of several \r\n   organizations. My background is initially that of a programmer and later \r\n   that of an agile process coach, and I'll explore my journey understanding \r\n   UED practices and how they map to popular agile processes, mainly Scrum and \r\n   Extreme Programming. I'll chronicle the teams' struggles to come to grips \r\n   with the often programming-centric orientation of agile processes, and their \r\n   ongoing efforts to integrate their UED best practices into the incremental, \r\n   collaborative world of agile processes.

12938	Improving Communication between customers and developers	Reducing waste and building a system based on the right requirements are \r\n   key benefits of agile methods. Agile delivers on this promise thanks to \r\n   constant business user involvement with developers, and frequent \r\n   checkpoints of working software to encourage a tight feedback loop. \r\n\r\n    In multiple years of exposure to complex business problems that our \r\n    clients present us, however, we have found situations where these \r\n    traditional agile approaches have left us unprepared. In many cases, \r\n    our clients simply cannot continuously work with us because of the \r\n    nature of their business. In others, the complexity of the business \r\n    problem is such that producing working code takes significantly longer \r\n    than we would like. In both cases, we still need to make sure business \r\n    people communicate well with developers, so that we can build the best \r\n    system possible for our clients. In the context of an actual case study \r\n    involving a system developed for the U.S. military, we present a suite \r\n    of techniques we have developed to address these tough but not uncommon \r\n    situations.

12939	The Cost/Benefit Paradox of Automated Acceptance Testing	Using FIT for automated acceptance testing supports a process in which developers and customers collaborate on a single executable specification for each story, i.e. the FIT documents.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy collaborating closely on the FIT documents, the developers and customers reach a shared understanding of the domain and develop the ubiquitous language of the application.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur experience with this process was ultimately successful but not completely pain free. In this experience report we highlight the benefits and pitfalls and share techniques for achieving successful developer and customer collaboration in specifying executable FIT documents.

This paper describes \r\nour experiences when using business-facing tests (also known as "story tests") \r\nto guide the porting of a legacy application.  Domain experts specified \r\ntests in a tabular format using Excel spreadsheets.  Developers automated \r\nthese spreadsheets in various ways over time: scripts, generation of JUnit \r\nsource code, and Fit.  These tests were run against the legacy system and \r\nguided the development of the newly ported system.  We found test-driven \r\nporting to be an effective way to port a complex application.

12941	Ongoing Quality Improvement, or: How We All Learned To Trust XP	Since VA Software adopted XP 2 1/2 years ago, the understanding of quality \r\n   and the product quality itself have changed dramatically. When we \r\n   started with XP our code had alpha quality. Features were tolerably \r\n   implemented, the UI was very bad and documentation was not even started. \r\n   Today, the complete product (code, UI, documentation, SDKs) is \r\n   constantly at pre-GA level. At any point in our development we can \r\n   provide pre-releases to our customers without any additional testing or \r\n   release effort. Before we adopted XP it took us up to 1 1/2 man years (6 QA \r\n   engineers for 3 months) to bring a product release from development end \r\n   to release. Our first XP release was 6 man months (4 QA engineers for 6 \r\n   weeks). Now we are down to 6 man weeks (2 QA engineers for 3 weeks).\r\n\r\n   For experienced XP practitioners it might seem strange that the \r\n   quality did not immediately jump to the high level that we have today \r\n   after adopting XP. This was caused by a scenario that seems to be very \r\n   typical for companies that have an established waterfall-based \r\n   development process: the engineering team was enthusiastic about the new \r\n   way of development, the product management team was indifferent and. the \r\n   QA team was highly skeptical of the promise of XP to generate an (almost) \r\n   bug-free product without a long and manual testing effort after \r\n   development was done. Nobody in the engineering or product management \r\n   team had any experience with XP, so it was impossible to convince the QA \r\n   team otherwise. (In fact, reports of bug-free code from other XP teams \r\n   were more intimidating then inspiring) So, we started our XP process \r\n   without full QA involvement and a full system test phase after \r\n   development was done.\r\n   This session recounts the evolution of our development process. \r\n   It shows all the phases that our process went through, major changes \r\n   that we made and what the overall impact was.

12942	There Has to Be a Better Way!	This is a story about how we influenced an organization developing Class III \r\nmedical device systems and software to adopt Agile Software Development \r\npractices.  Our story describes our frustrations with waterfall and plan-based \r\nmethods, how we came to be interested in Agile and why, and how we facilitated \r\nthe necessary changes.  Finally, our story talks about surveys of our \r\ndevelopment teams that exhibit powerful evidence that we may actually be on the \r\npath to a "better way".	Experience Reports	Experience Report	2005
12943	Waltzing with Changes	"The only thing that is a constant is change." - Greek philosopher, Heraclitus\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n   This idiom is especially true when dealing with a software development \r\n   project.  With varying degrees, change impacts project delivery, budget, and \r\n   quality.  Often in today's environment, the requirements for higher quality \r\n   software combined with compressed timelines and fewer developers can make \r\n   change management a difficult task.  This paper focuses on how agile \r\n   practices play a role in managing changes in an industrial software project \r\n   developed at TransCanada.  We discuss how the impacts of changes in \r\n   resources, changes in requirements, and external factors can be minimized.  \r\n   We examine numerous methods of overcoming challenges that often occur during \r\n   industrial software development.

12944	Agile Contracts: How to develop contracts that support agile software development	Agile Development sounds great, but it depends on the ability to determine the details of scope as the \r\n\tsystem is developed, driven by feedback from customers and users.  Much software development is done \r\n\tunder contract, where there is often a requirement to determine the details of the system early in the development process.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12945	Delivering value early	The ideal XP project allows the team to ship the code as soon as the next features are ready. In practice, \r\n\tmany organizations cannot (or will not) accept this, so the team has to find ways to reduce the stress of \r\n\treleasing or, better, produce something of value to the organization before the final delivery.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn this workshop, participants will exchange experiences and ideas about how to maneuver a project into \r\n\tdelivering real value early, even where the organization itself is not Agile.

12946	IEEE 1648 Recommended Practice for Agile Methods	Audience:  Those already working on this IEEE effort as well as those who want to get an update on what is \r\n\thappening with it.  People attending should have a reasonably strong interest in work on this standard, \r\n\tthough the first part of the session will be an overview for those less committed to working on it who wish to \r\n\tknow where it stands.\r\n\t\r\n\tGoal:  Review the existing proposed content and take ideas for additions and changes.\r\n\t\r\n\tProcess:\r\n\tThe first 15-20 minutes will be an overview of where the work stands which I will present.\r\n\tThe next 15-20 minutes will be an open discussion on the material covering what a customer should know \r\n\tabout their responsibilities in a relationship with an agile development group.\r\n\tThe next 15-20 minutes will be an open discussion on the material covering what a customer should expect \r\n\tfrom an agile development group.\r\n\tThe next 15-20 minutes will be an open discussion on the material covering issues confronting agile \r\n\tmethods in a more formal methodology environment.\r\n\tThe last 15-20 minutes will discuss relationship of this work with other standards.\r\n\t\r\n\tDeliverables:  Updated draft material for the standard with a summary to be prepared after the conference \r\n\tand posted to the conference wiki.

12947	How to apply agile development methods in open source projects	There is a strong affinity between the agile development and the open source communities.  Many projects \r\n\tusing agile development are supported by a wide array of open source tools.  Agile development methods \r\n\thave influenced the organization of many open source projects.  However, many of the assumptions and \r\n\tstructures of the most common agile methods are hard to directly apply in an open source setting.  Typically \r\n\topen source projects are much more widely distributed than the typical agile development project, and \r\n\tparticipants are usually volunteers, employees or a combination of both, as in the example of Apache and \r\n\tJBoss.  How can agile development methods be applied to solving the challenges of managing open source \r\n\tprojects?  During this workshop we will seek to explore these questions.  Participants will be invited to share \r\n\ttheir experience in applying agile development methods in open source projects, or their thoughts on approaches \r\n\tthat could be explored.

12948	Androgogical Approaches to Learning in the Agile Software Development Team	This workshop will explore the implications of androgogy (an inquiry-based educational ideology most \r\n\tfrequently appropriate for adult learning) for agile software development teams.  Often, one of the motivators\r\n\t for agility is the fact that technologies change frequently and therefore teams must adapt.  When the \r\n\tchange requires new learning, the standard response is to send people off to training for 3 days or a week \r\n\tand then expect them to be productive with the new tool, technology, or methodology.  This workshop will \r\n\tbring together professionals, academicians and managers to discuss approaches to learning while doing \r\n\tbased on characteristics of adult learners, particularly in the context of the agile software development team.

12949	Living the Declaration of Interdependence	In January 2005 a group of agile leaders met in Seattle and created the "Declaration of Interdependence". \r\n\tThe purpose of this group is to start building an alternative to PMI and IPMI for agile project managers - and \r\n\tthe first shipable result of our work is the Declaration:\r\n\t* We increase return on investment by making continuous flow of value our focus.\r\n\t* We deliver reliable results by engaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership. \r\n\t* We manage uncertainty through iterations, anticipation and adaptation. \r\n\t* We unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing that individuals are the ultimate source of value, and \r\n\tcreating an environment where they can make a difference. \r\n\t* We boost performance through group accountability for results and shared responsibility for team \r\n\teffectiveness. \r\n\t* We improve effectiveness and reliability through situationally specific strategies, processes and practices.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn this workshop we will examine each of the 6 parts of the declaration. As a participant you will have the \r\n\tchance to share your experiences and to participate in the description of practices that have proven \r\n\tthemselves to support the way of working, that is described by the declaration.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis workshop will be run as an open space discussion - and the process will be exactly the same as the \r\n\tprocess used to come up with the Declaration of Interdependence in Seattle in January.

12950	The Courage to Communicate: Collaborative Skills for Agile Teams	Communication, Feedback, Courage, Simplicity. Individuals and interactions over process and tools. \r\n\tApplying the values of Agile approaches to software development projects highlights a shift to increased \r\n\timportance of functioning well in highly collaborative team environments.  The initial excitement of trying \r\n\tsomething new and the intense learning curve of understanding and applying the practices tends to \r\n\tovershadow team member interactions through the first stages of project team development. However, once \r\n\tXP/Agile practices become the usual way of doing business, team members frequently discover the limits of \r\n\ttheir ability to communicate and work collaboratively. Effective, collaborative communication becomes the \r\n\tnext challenge. Three skills in particular help a team make the move from adequate work performance to \r\n\thigh performance. In this highly interactive, experiential tutorial, participants learn the critical collaborative \r\n\tskills of group decision-making, active listening and interpersonal feedback - seeking it, giving \r\n\tit, and receiving it well.

12951	Roadmap to Agile Testing	So you want to increase \r\n    your testing agility, but aren't sure how to get there from here? Are you \r\n    somewhere en route to agility and want to correlate experiences with your \r\n    peers? Perhaps you've done extensive exploration in the jungles of Agile \r\n    testing, but aren't quite ready to open up guided tours? Creating a \r\n    roadmap to Agile testing adoption can help us organize and distill our \r\n    experiences and make our journey more enjoyable. This workshop will \r\n    provide an opportunity to share real experiences and distill lessons \r\n    learned from them, which will help particpants at all levels of adoption \r\n    of Agile testing to build and improve their own roadmaps forward.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12952	Informative Workspace	Informative Workspace is one of the new XP practices launched in the second edition of XP Explained. The \r\n\tpractice is to build feedback mechanisms around an agile team that support them in their daily work. These \r\n\tfeedback mechanisms can take the form of visual displays (Information Radiators) that are manually updated \r\n\tby the team or electronic eXtreme Feedback Devices (XFD) such as lava lamps or audio signals linked to \r\n\tautomated processes. It is vital to ensure that feedback mechanisms are easy to interpret, low maintenance \r\n\tand adapted to local practices. In this session we will work on new ways to support an Informative Workspace.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12953	Becoming a Collaborative Leader	What is a collaborative leader? What can I do to become one? These are the questions that we will collaboratively answer in this workshop.\r\nIn this workshop, we will define Collaborative Leadership and compare this with the command and control model and, after each participant compares their current leadership style with the collaborative model, strategies for reaching the full collaborative model will be developed.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12954	Workshop on Agile Transition Management	The goal of this workshop\r\n     will be to come up with a list of things that an organization must do on\r\n     their way to becoming agile. Beyond making a partial list of these \r\n     items we plan to work on developing information on how to accomplish \r\n     each and dependencies between them. For example, "Select a pilot \r\n     project" may be one of the items. If that is one of special interest \r\n     to the attending group we will focus on identify steps necessary to or \r\n     guidelines on how to make that selection.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12955	Stop interacting with the customer! (...until you know the safety rules.)	Pivotal to all agile \r\n    methods is the notion that customers work closely with the development team. Regardless of the excellent customer interaction techniques you've learned elsewhere, you will not be successful until you have established a working relationship. As with any relationship, things can go wrong.\r\nIn this peer to peer session, we will learn to navigate the pitfalls in \r\ncustomer interaction. Endowed with a few simple guidelines, techniques, \r\nand knowledge you and your budding agile team will have the courage to be \r\nmore involved with customers.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12956	Achieving Closure: Best Practices for Ending the Iteration	Agile software teams face \r\n    some common problems in doing iterative/time-boxed development.  \r\n    While coaching such teams, we have encountered the following types of \r\n    challenges with ending the iteration successfully.\r\n    \r\n  How do you enforce a true "hard stop" for each iteration?\r\n\r\n  How do you get the entire project community aligned around the iteration "rhythm"?  \r\n\r\n  How do you appropriately celebrate success and make progress visible to stakeholders?\r\n\r\n  How do you get the customer involved in truly "steering" the development effort and providing meaningful feedback?\r\n\r\n  How does hands-on user acceptance testing fit into the iterative schedule?\r\n    \r\n    We have found that specific end-of-iteration activities can be established and structured that address all of these issues.  We are interested in sharing our ideas and in hearing how others have overcome similar problems.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12957	Technical Retrospectives	The goal of the \r\n    Technical Retrospectives is to help the team build a set of common \r\n    models that can be used to improve their collective understanding of the \r\n    current design of the system - it is a learning exercise.  We do this \r\n    through various low-fidelity collaborative exercises that encourage us \r\n    to externalise our internal models of the software, and to explore the \r\n    differences that may exist between our understandings - we do this at \r\n    the end of each iteration.  An additional benefit we have found is that \r\n    the documentation produced from this exercise gives us a historic \r\n    snapshot record (a time-series animation, of sorts) of the design \r\n    decisions made by the team, and allow us to reflect and reason about \r\n    why the system design evolved to its current state - useful to current \r\n    team members and also those that will join later in the life of the \r\n    software.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12958	Agile Thinking Workshop	An "Agile Thinking Workshop" \r\n    can be used at any level in an organization to introduce Agile principles.  \r\n    It provides participants with an opportunity to explore new ways of thinking \r\n    and behaving and to experience, through a variety of different activities the \r\n    Agile dynamics of self-organization, visibility and emergence.  Using a number \r\n    of different approaches, and relying strongly on experiential learning \r\n    techniques this kind of workshop provides a self-directed learning experience \r\n    which fosters an Agile mind-set and prepares participants for the Agile \r\n    challenge. \r\n    The "Agile Thinking Workshop" Workshop at Agile 2005 will allow \r\n    facilitators, or potential facilitators to experience first-hand a set of \r\n    experiential exercises that they may find useful to introduce into their own \r\n    organizations, to enhance existing Agile training.  The workshop itself will \r\n    emerge from the input of its participants.  It is not formulaic.  There may be \r\n    an output; that too will be determined by the participants.  The focus however \r\n    is on process, not product.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12959	Hiring an Agile Tester	Your agile team wants \r\n    to hire a tester.  But there aren't a lot of folks out there calling \r\n    themselves 'agile testers'.  There are plenty of talented testers out \r\n    there who don't know anything about agile development.  How do you find \r\n    them?  When you're hiring a tester for an agile team, what skills, \r\n    characteristics and experience should you look for?  Where should you \r\n    look?  How do you determine if a candidate has the right attitude and \r\n    mindset, let alone the skills your team needs to add?  What questions \r\n    do you ask in phone screening?  What interview questions identify a \r\n    good fit for your team?  In this workshop, participants will work in \r\n    groups and all together to identify where to look for potential 'agile' \r\n    testers, what to include in the job posting, how to screen and interview, \r\n    and other tips to finding the right person to join your team wearing a \r\n    'tester' hat.

12960	Extreme Teams Game	It can be difficult to \r\n    demonstrate how multiple agile teams can work together, in this tutorial \r\n    participants will learn how to play and lead the Extreme Teams Game.  \r\n    The Extreme Teams Game is a simple game that requires nothing more than \r\n    pens, index cards, and a bit of preparation to demonstrate the impact of \r\n    changing communication and feedback between multiple agile teams \r\n    working together.  Past, present, and possible future team interactions \r\n    will also be discussed.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12961	Tools for Acceptance Testing	Frequent iterations \r\n    make automating acceptance tests especially important to agile teams, \r\n    yet many struggle to make this a reality. Commercial tools often seem \r\n    designed for more traditional divisions of labor. In this workshop we \r\n    will explore the tools that agile teams have used, successfully or not, \r\n    for automating acceptance tests. Are there common characteristics to \r\n    successful tools? Are there commercial tools that are well-suited to \r\n    agile teams?\r\n    We encourage participants to come ready to share their stories \r\n    about tools they've used on agile projects. We expect to hear from \r\n    users of Fit, HttpUnit, QuickTest, Abbot and many other tools.\r\n\r\n    This workshop will result in a report summarizing the views and \r\n    experiences of the participants, and any patterns or trends that emerge. \r\n\r\n    Logistics: Participants will be encouraged to write experience \r\n    reports in advance of the conference. These will be published on a \r\n    website. Participants who have submitted reports will be given priority \r\n    in the discussion. The workshop will use the LAWST-method of facilitated \r\n    discussion.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12962	Agile Embedded Software Workshop	Embedded software has its own set of challenges like limited resources, \r\n    timing constraints, safety concerns, and custom IO as well as all the \r\n    classical problems with software development.  The goal of this workshop is \r\n    to bring together experienced embedded software developers, manager and \r\n    customers.  Those using agile techniques and those thinking about it are \r\n    welcome.\r\nWe would like to hear your experiences and plans.  Come prepared to discuss \r\nyour challenges and the creative agile solutions.  What results are you \r\ngetting?  Has agile improved your delivery? Has agile improved your \r\nreliability? Has agile improved your maintainability? Is it too soon to tell?  \r\nDo you have any metrics?  We would like to collect effective practices, discuss \r\nsolutions to embedded development problems, and hear about attendees \r\nexperiences.  \r\n\r\nMaybe you are considering adopting agile techniques for your embedded \r\nsoftware development team.  What issues are you trying to solve?  What are \r\nthe challenges in your organization?\r\n\r\nExperienced attendees are encouraged to write up a list of the practices \r\nthey are using and the results they have achieved.   Attendees evaluating\r\nagile methods should bring their goals, concerns and hopes.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12963	Test Driven Development and Beyond	Test Driven Development \r\n    is becoming a mainstream practice.  However, it is a step along the \r\n    way, not a final destination.  This workshop will explore what the next \r\n    steps and side paths are, such as Behavior Driven Development, Example \r\n    Driven Development, Story-Test Driven Development.	Workshops	Workshop	2005
12964	Leadership in Extreme Programming	Nobody said that XP was going to be easy, just effective. Anyone who is \r\n\r\ninvolved in applying XP will encounter obstacles that tests their \r\n\r\nabilities to deliver code and create an effective organisation, and \r\n\r\nsome of the ideas in XP contradict conventional wisdom about software \r\n\r\ndevelopment. The growing number of books offer guidance but an outside, \r\n\r\nhuman perspective can also be helpful.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\tIn this workshop, a team of expert practitioners will offer practical \r\n\r\nadvice on how to address the issues you are facing when applying XP. \r\n\r\nThe format is to consider real-life examples from the participants, to \r\n\r\ntalk about what we would do in these situations, and discuss the \r\n\r\nprinciples behind the actions. The goal is to help the participants to \r\n\r\nbe more effective in response to their "leadership moments" as they \r\n\r\napply XP. The practitioners are either managers who have applied XP, or \r\n\r\nconsultants who have converted many different organisations to XP.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe workshop will be kept small to encourage open discussion so, if \r\n\r\nyou'd like to join in, please drop a brief note describing your \r\n\r\nsituation to WK12@m3p.co.uk, or contact Steve Freeman during the \r\n\r\nconference.

12966	Crossing the Chasm with Agile Methodologies in Software Engineering Education	The introduction of agile methodologies into software engineering\r\neducation progressed much as the marketing of high tech products.  There\r\nwere a small number of "technology enthusiasts" and "visionaries" who began\r\nteaching agile processes and practices very early while the "pragmatists,"\r\n"conservatives," and "skeptics" considered these new teachings to advocate\r\nhacking and to be anti-software engineering.  In this talk, Dr. Williams\r\nwill provide insight into the adoption lifecycle of agile methodologies in\r\nsoftware engineering education and the benefits of this adoption.

12967	Introducing Agile into a Software Development Capstone Project	Conveying principles of software analysis, design and implementation in a \r\nclassroom setting is problematic. When the course involves actual hands on \r\ndevelopment with clients drawn from industry, the challenges are magnified. \r\nThis paper discusses the experiences and observations of a set of 10-month \r\nindependent external projects undertaken by final year students in the \r\nComputer Systems Technology Program using Agile for the first time. We \r\ncompare situations and observations of projects developed following an \r\nAgile approach with XP Programming, to our previous projects developed in a \r\ntraditional approach. Based on these observations, an Agile approach seems \r\nto support learning, provide a valuable practical experience and produce \r\nuseable software within an academic environment.

12968	Experiences Teaching a Course in Programmer Testing	We teach a class on programmer-testing with a primary focus on test-driven \r\ndevelopment (TDD) as part of the software engineering curriculum at the \r\nFlorida Institute of Technology. As of this writing, the course has been \r\noffered 3 times. Each session contained a mixture of undergraduate and \r\ngraduate students. This paper discusses the evolution of the course, our \r\nlessons learned and plans for enhancing the course in the future.	Educator's Symposium	Educator Paper	2005
12969	Balancing Hands-on and Research Activities: A Graduate Level Agile Software Development Course	Agile software methodologies promote developing better software faster and \r\nhave been gaining popularity in the industry. However, agile is still \r\nsomewhat a stranger to the academic world. While it is important to \r\nintroduce agile methods to undergraduate students, we believe that having a \r\ngraduate-level course in agile development is as crucial. We offered a \r\ntopic course dedicated to teach agile software development to graduate \r\nstudents emphasizing both hands-on experience and research activities. In \r\nthis course, a phase-in project approach was used with real customers on \r\nreal projects. The result of this approach was well received by students \r\nand has stimulated student research interests in the area. This paper \r\ndescribes our experiences in offering the course.

12970	How much Agile Should we Teach in a Software Engineering Course? Panel	Agile methods have shown strength in recent years. Although behind the \r\n    curve, academics are catching up in adapting agile methods in the classroom. \r\n    Other than teaching or using agile practices in various computer science \r\n    courses, many academics have also reported teaching agile methods in \r\n    software engineering (SE) courses. However, other than sporadic experience \r\n    reports, there is not sufficient evidence on how much agile coverage is \r\n    best for students in SE classes. Some argue that all agile is as bad as no \r\n    agile while others believe that agile is the way of the future. In this \r\n    panel, we will discuss the balance of agile and traditional methods in a \r\n    SE course. Some of the questions to be discussed include:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs it necessary to introduce traditional methods such as Waterfall among \r\nothers in a SE course?\r\n\r\nWill students be disadvantaged without adequate exposure to traditional \r\nmethods since they are still widely used in the industry?\r\n\r\nAssuming that teaching agile methods is necessary, should agile methods be \r\nthe primary emphasis in a SE course? Will a simple overview of agile methods be \r\nsufficient?\r\n\r\nIs XP a good representative of agile methods or should we introduce other \r\nagile methods? Which ones?\r\n\r\nShould agile methods be required for projects, if any, in a SE course?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditional questions are encouraged from the audience.

12971	Student Experiences with Executable Acceptance Testing	This report describes experiences of introducing executable acceptance \r\ntesting in senior software engineering courses. Students in an agile \r\nenvironment completed a five-iteration project with significant portion of \r\nrequirements specified as executable acceptance tests. Furthermore, \r\nstudents were required to write their test suites for an additional \r\ncomponent. Ability to learn and utilize the FIT acceptance testing \r\nframework is evaluated to find out if FIT tests can be used to replace \r\nrequirement documents.  The results of a survey of students' perceptions \r\nand experiences were encouraging.	Educator's Symposium	Educator Paper	2005
12972	Teaching Agile Project Management to the Project Management Institute (PMI)	This paper describes the experience of teaching Agile Project Management\r\nprinciples as part of the Project Management Institute (PMI) Annual\r\nConference (The PMI Global Congress) and subsequently as part of their\r\napproved traveling training series (The PMI SeminarsWorld Series). It\r\noutlines the challenges of getting material that conflicts with many\r\ntraditional views of project management accepted by the PMI. It also\r\ncontrasts learning styles between students at the PMI SeminarsWorld\r\nseries, who have, on average over 20 years IT experience and graduate\r\nstudents covering the same material as part of an MSc program who have\r\non average 3 years IT experience.

12973	Undergraduate Student Perceptions of Pair Programming and Agile Software Methodologies: Verifying a Model of Social Interaction	One of the reasons that undergraduate students, particularly women and \r\n    minorities, can become disenchanted with computer science education is \r\n    because software development is wrongly characterized as a solitary \r\n    activity.  We conducted a collective case study in a software \r\n    engineering course at North Carolina State University to ascertain the \r\n    effects of a collaborative pedagogy intervention on student \r\n    perceptions.  The pedagogy intervention was based upon the practices of \r\n    agile software development with a focus on pair programming.  Six \r\n    representative students in the course participated in the study. Their \r\n    perspectives helped validate a social interaction model of student \r\n    views. The findings suggest that pair programming and agile software \r\n    methodologies contribute to more effective learning opportunities for \r\n    computer science students and that students understand and appreciate \r\n    these benefits.

12974	Introduction to Agile Software Development	: In this talk Hubert Smits \r\n    provides a broad introduction to concepts of agile software development and \r\n    agile methods. The talk is based on his experience as an agile coach and \r\n    Certified Scrum Master. Concepts that are known from waterfall or \r\n    plan-driven development are transformed to an agile perspective. Examples \r\n    are release and iteration planning, progress reporting, meeting formats and \r\n    scaling projects from 10 people teams to 300 people teams. The session will \r\n    be interactive and following agile principles: there is more value in \r\n    responding to change than following a plan.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
12975	Engineering Practices of Agile Teams	This session will present short introductions to four practices of agile \r\n    teams. First up will be Gerard Meszaros, a partner at Clearstream Consulting \r\n    and author of Effectiveness of Automated Testing. Gerard will discuss Agile \r\n    Requirements with User Stories. User stories are a lightweight approach to \r\n    requirements gathering that shift the focus from written documents to \r\n    conversation and help projects be agile from their inception. Next up will \r\n    be Mike Cohn of Mountain Goat Software and author of User Stories Applied \r\n    and the upcoming Agile Estimating and Planning. Mike will be discussing \r\n    Release and Iteration Planning, which are important skills for answering \r\n    questions such as when will the product ship, in what order should we build \r\n    features, and how much can we commit to? Next will be Jim Highsmith, author \r\n    of Agile Project Management, Adaptive Software Development, and other books. \r\n    Jim will present on how Agile Project Management supports reliable \r\n    innovation. The final session will be presented by Ward Cunningham and Rick \r\n    Mugridge. Ward is a consultant with C2 and the inventor of FIT, the \r\n    Framework for Integrated Test, along with many other things such as wikis, \r\n    Extreme Programming, and CRC cards. Rick Mugridge is an associate professor \r\n    at the University of Auckland and is the co-author (with Ward) of Fit for \r\n    Developing Software. Rick and Ward will be showing how to perform Acceptance \r\n    Testing with FIT and FitNesse, two related and widely acclaimed, open source \r\n    tools.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
12976	Agile Development Methodologies	Firstly Jean Tabaka, agile coach with Rally Software, will introduce \r\n    Scrum. Her story is based on her experience as a Scrum Master, Facilitator \r\n    and Agile Coach. She will take you through the core of Scrum: the customer \r\n    ownership of the planning process, monitoring the delivery progress through \r\n    daily stand-up meetings and simple reporting, and finally the iteration \r\n    review. Jean expects to publish her book on Facilitation in Agile Projects \r\n    in the autumn. Following Jean with an exploration of Extreme Programming is \r\n    Bob Martin. 'Uncle Bob' is known as co-author, with James Newkirk, of XP in \r\n    Practice, and author of Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, \r\n    and Practices. Bob will cover the 12 practices that build up the XP software \r\n    development method and share his experience as an implementer of the method.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
12977	More Practices of Agile Teams	The four speakers for this afternoon take you through four more practices \r\n    that are widely used in the agile community. Mike Clark, author of Pragmatic \r\n    Project Automation, starts the session with Project Automation, a \r\n    practice that provides agile teams with the required support for their short \r\n    development cycles. Mike wrote the online JUnit Primer and developed \r\n    JUnitPerf, an open source collection of JUnit extensions for performance and \r\n    scalability testing. Test Driven Development has moved from one of the 12 XP \r\n    practices into a practice that is widely accepted in agile development \r\n    teams. Joe Rainsberger, author of JUnit Recipes, and founder and president of \r\n    Diaspar Software, highlights and demonstrates this practice. The afternoon \r\n    closes with an introduction by Scott Ambler into Agile Model Driven \r\n    Development (AMDD) and Agile Database Techniques. Scott is the \r\n    well-known author of such books as Agile Modeling, The Object Primer, and \r\n    Agile Database Techniques.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
12978	Invited Talks Thursday July 28, 2005	At some point while deploying Agile concepts within your organization, \r\n    you will find that you need to make changes in areas not under your \r\n    control.  You know what needs to be altered, but you don't have the \r\n    authority to make those improvements.  \r\n    At this point, are you blocked?  Will your Agile movement go no \r\n    further?  \r\n    Are all the benefits of Agile to be lost?\r\n\r\n    Not in the least!  Actually the most powerful and successful way of \r\n    install lasting change is from a position where you do not have the authority \r\n    over that change.\r\n\r\n    To proceed, you need to use some simple techniques where you effectively \r\n    lead from a position of no power.

12980	Commoditizing Agility	Many organizations can't afford quality, enterprise-wide transitions to \r\n    agility. The costs are simply too high in dollars or time. As a result, \r\n    organizations have settled for watered-down transitions that fail to \r\n    realize the true potential of agility. To dramatically lower the cost \r\n    of agile transitions, we must commoditize agility. Join Joshua \r\n    Kerievsky as he explores the strategies, tools and collaborations \r\n    necessary to help agility succeed on a grand scale.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
12981	Vendor Presentations 2005	Over the last few years, the software development community at large \r\n    has come to recognize the value of agility. Agile methods such as XP, \r\n    SCRUM and others have proven to be a most effective catalyst to *better \r\n    software, sooner*. And while we're still relatively early in the \r\n    adoption curve, there seem to be limitations in sight. Not limitations \r\n    in the sense of how effective agility can be, or even to what kind of \r\n    problem can it be applied. This limitation is much more insidious - \r\n    it's a restriction of who can apply it or where they can apply it. \r\n    Differences aside, several agile methods and their pundits agree: \r\n    'agile software development begins with developers and customer in one \r\n    room'. No such statement exists in the Agile Manifesto, but two passages \r\n    from that infamous decree seem to support the idea of co-location as \r\n    prescribed by the most popular agile methods. But why must this be? Such \r\n    a limitation seems to preclude attempting agility in a multi-site or \r\n    globally distributed team. Most agilites would agree and perhaps \r\n    suggest "better to do your project with a smaller scope and a smaller, \r\n    co-located team". But in these days of globally distributed business we \r\n    find very real situations of globally distributed customers. \r\n    Recommending a co-located team may not be feasible or even logical when \r\n    considering other factors. So what then? Are we confined to experience \r\n    the benefits of agility only when working with a co-located team? The \r\n    Manifesto states that "business people and developers must work together \r\n    daily throughout the project" and "the most efficient and effective \r\n    method of conveying information to and within a development team is \r\n    face-to-face conversation". Why must the \r\nrequirement of face-to-face communication be tied so tightly to only one \r\nsolution: co-location? Indeed, agile methods can and should be utilized by \r\nmulti-site teams, offshore development projects, open source, and all forms \r\nof projects co-located and distributed alike. This discussion recounts one \r\ncompany's experience applying agility to globally distributed teams. Come \r\nhear and see what worked, what failed and what work-arounds made it \r\npossible to distribute agility to global teams.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005

12983	"Tooling to Scale Software Agility: How to enable critical project visibility and coordination for distributed Agile teams	As larger, distributed development teams adopt Agile practices they often \r\n    find themselves lacking the team coordination and project visibility \r\n    required to reliably deliver software in rapid, fully-tested iterations.  \r\n \r\n    Scaling agile practices beyond the co-located team presents several \r\n    challenges. Ad-hoc tools or heavy-weight project management systems simply \r\n    do not provide the real-time communication and coordination required for \r\n    the distributed software team to reap the benefits of agile practices.  \r\n    Additionally, the productivity of global teams suffers without a common \r\n    understanding of how to set project priorities and objectively measure the \r\n    team's progress. \r\n \r\n    In this session, Ryan Martens, founder and president of Rally Software \r\n    will discuss Rally's experience in scaling the enterprise project \r\n    visibility that distributed Agile teams need to be more responsive to \r\n    fast-changing business priorities and new customer opportunities.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
12984	"Showcasing" Agile Development:An Adoption Strategy for Large Organizations	Many large organizations could benefit from adopting some form of agile \r\n    software development.  However, larger companies typically face \r\n    significant organizational barriers to the type of change that agile \r\n    adoption mandates.  Without some evidence that the benefits will \r\n    outweigh the costs in their environment, these organizations are \r\n    hesitant to begin experimenting with agile practices in a significant \r\n    way.\r\n\r\n    In our work over the last several years with large companies, \r\n    we have developed a successful technique for addressing this situation \r\n    which we call "showcasing."  Showcasing is essentially the outsourcing \r\n    of a project to an independent group that can model and demonstrate the \r\n    agile approach while assuming the responsibility for successful project \r\n    completion.  Showcasing sets up a situation where the client can see \r\n    and experience the benefits of agile development while minimizing the \r\n    organizational risks associated with introducing a new process.\r\n\r\n    In this session, we will cover the showcasing technique, and \r\n    discuss our successful use of showcasing as a first step towards agile \r\n    adoption with several Fortune 500 companies.  Attendees will leave with \r\n    a greater understanding of showcasing's value as a tool in the agile \r\n    change agent's arsenal.	Introduction to Agile	Tutorial	2005
20105271	Patterns for customer interaction	When agile practices are introduced in an organization, one of the challenges that can face a development team is to begin meaningful interaction with real customers. Often those of us with technical backgrounds have spent little time studying or appreciating the effort involved in improving our communication skills, especially with those who are not technical. In response to this dilemma, a set of patterns to enhance customer interaction has been written and published and will be presented in this session.	Leadership & Culture	Invited Tutorial	2010
20108589	Behaviour Driven Development with Cucumber	Cucumber is all the rage these days, but many teams struggle to understand how and when to use it. It is designed to be an Acceptance Testing tool in the context of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), but that explanation tends to bring up even more questions.\n\nAslak Hellesøy, the author of Cucumber will help you to understand how to use Cucumber effectively. Attendees will learn BDD fundamentals and will develop a small application using Cucumber. They can choose between Java, Ruby and .NET.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105387	Dance of the Tester, An Iteration-Length Performance	Ever wonder what a tester does on an agile team? It can be confusing for everyone on the  team trying to understand when there isn't a test phase or any formal documented requirements.\n\nIn this tutorial, we follow an agile tester. We start with how testers contribute during release and iteration planning. Then we follow a tester through a typical two-week iteration, from the start through to the end, to see what activities he does and how he adds value. Like a dance, everyone has a role in the finale, so we look at the agile tester's role in a successful release, including the end game.	Testing/Specification Practices	Invited Tutorial	2010
20108603	Improv: The Mechanics of Collaboration	As businesses delve into Agile practices dysfunctions arise that can not be eliminated using traditional operational processes.  A one-step-at-a-time approach is being replaced by leaps of whatever length necessary.  The complex, rapidly changing market demands are best met by teams for whom shifting paradigms feel like home.\n \nA study of improvisational theater is a pertinent supplement to the training of Agile practitioners.\n\nMatt Smith breaks the essence of collaboration into small, identifiable parts and leads  a series of exercises the way a strength coach might. 	Business Transformation	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105364	Mastering Dependencies in Your Product Backlog	Reduce risks and rework by mastering dependencies in your product backlog. Learn the differences between process flow and process dependencies, identify story dependencies via state transitions and pre and post-conditions, detect data dependencies using interaction matrices, and elicit dependent business rules. Visualize delivery and development options with a minimal marketable features (MMF) dependency graph. Analyze and manage your dependencies, identify core functionality and delivery options, and gain a vital perspective on what to build and when to build it.	Expressing User Needs	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105548	7 Tools for the Product Owner Interfacing with an Agile Development Team	How do you capture your thoughts about a product so you can answer the developer questions at the release and sprint planning meetings? What tools let you weigh unexpected new feature requests? \n\nThis tutorial introduces 7 connected thinking tools that take you from product purpose statement, through stakeholders'-motivations, in/out list, Kano's subjective product qualities, actors & goals and use cases to Jeff Patton's storymap, which serves as a 2-dimensional product backlog to the iteration/sprint planning meeting. 90 minutes is short, but should be sufficient to show the tools.	Expressing User Needs	Invited Tutorial	2010
20106139	How Agile Taught IBM about New Leadership Competencies	Join Sue McKinney as she discusses her experiences leading the move to agile at IBM, how their agile teams often struggled, and initiated an evolution in leadership skills.  Sue looked for tools leaders could use to increase productivity, even after cost cutting, unleash the talent and innovation agile teams need to continue succeeding. She talks about Agile adoption, the approach and challenges to getting new leadership tools to stick.  You will learn what was needed to inspire and motivate change in large organizations, identifying change agents, and give ownership to the teams.	Organization & Enterprises	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105677	Agility @ Scale - Experiences from the Trenches at IBM Rational	What happens when a team experienced with agile Open Source development (Eclipse) gets involved in product development at IBM Rational? Obviously the team wants to continue to be agile, but now some additional scaling factors come into play. How do you collaborate effectively with the business organization? How do you collaborate with a traditional system testing organization? How do you collaborate on features that span  product organizations? Three years into our journey, this talk reflects on our experiences scaling agile as we faced increased technical and organizational complexity.	Organization & Enterprises	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105202	The Agile Scaling Model (ASM): Be as Agile as You Need to Be	The Agile Scaling Model (ASM) provides the context and advice for effectively tailoring agile techniques to meet the real-world situation that you find yourself in.  First, how to extend the agile construction life cycle to become a disciplined agile delivery life cycle is described.  Next, how to tailor agile practices to address scaling factors such as team size, physical distribution, organizational distribution, regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, technical complexity, and enterprise disciplines is presented.  Finally, industry statistics around scaling are summarized. 	Organization & Enterprises	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105285	Beyond Scope, Schedule, and Cost: Optimizing Value   	Traditional development emphasizes "following the plan with minimal changes,"whereas agile stresses "adapting successfully to inevitable changes". Today's business challenges require us to leverage turbulence to generate value. Since agility is about delivering customer value by being flexible, how can we measure performance by adherence to schedule, cost, and scope? We need to modify success measures  to build effective agile organizations. This session will explores concepts & practices for performance measurement using the Agile Triangle of value, quality, and constraints.	Business Transformation	Invited Tutorial	2010
20108588	Large scale, distributed development simulation	Reading and hearing about agile practices is one thing, but actually doing it is completely different. This workshop puts you to work in an agile fashion, applying agile development practices. During this workshop, we're going to take a problem and iteratively develop the solution, using test-driven development, pair programming, retrospectives, pair rotation, and other agile management & development techniques.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Invited Tutorial	2010
20106008	The Agile Organization: Applying Visioning and Learning Models	Agile organizations require more than a change in management structure. They require new ways of creating and sharing knowledge. In this session, I will present a case study and lead exercises for a set of knowledge-creating models. These include Verne Harnisch's cross-functional Rocks; Lean models of A3s, value stream maps, and PDCA; Dennis's True North and Mother Strategies; ORIDs; and Senge's personal visioning. I will then provide an organizational structure and meeting cadence we use to apply and re-inform these models on a regular basis. This is what creates an innovative organization.	Leadership & Culture	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105298	Leader's Workshop: Making Change Happen and Making it Stick	Lean transformations are challenging - and sustaining a lean transformation over time is even more difficult. So how do you get started, and how do you keep on improving over time? This session will recommend a three-pronged approach to successful change:    \n(1) Get developers personally involved in improving customer outcomes. (We'll cover product champions and Cost Center Disease.)   \n(2) Create a script for improvement that generates immediate action. (We'll look at strategy deployment.)  \n(3) Rethink the environment (including the governance system).\n	Enterprise Improvement	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105245	Exploring Coaching From Multiple Dimensions and Levels	Have you ever brought in a coach to work at the team level, but the problems were at the management level? Or, have you been brought in to coach managers, but the team isn't delivering on its promises--and they don't know why? You may have discovered that you work at multiple levels: one-on-one with the team members, facilitating team work, one-on-one with a manager, facilitating a manager's work, helping the team or the manager work up and down the organization. Experienced coaches George Dinwiddie and Johanna Rothman will help you explore the multiple dimensions and levels of coaching.	Coaching Agile	Invited Tutorial	2010
20106344	Ride the Agile Rocket as it Scales to New Highs - Marble Movers	The Marble Mover game is designed for people new to Agile or skeptical about Agile.\nparticipants (up to 5 teams of 7+-2) join a start up intent on dominating the world's marble moving market.  Where you live the Agile dream scaling a small and hardy band into progressively large teams until you are already to take on the BIG DEAL!\nThe games is meant to be a fun experience that takes nothing seriously except delivering value to an emergent customer base.\n\n\n	Team-Room Agile	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105514	Better Story Testing through Programmer-Tester Pairing	You know how "Agile" works: programmers test drive their code via (A)TDD with testers automating much of the story tests.  But how does it really work?  Do testers and programmers work together (YES!)?  What does this interaction look like?  In this hands-on demonstration, we'll walk you through how to drive quality on your projects by pairing testers and programmers.  We'll use FitNesse to create effective story tests and keep them passing as the software evolves with each iteration.  Bring a laptop and spend some time as a paired dev/test team!	Testing/Specification Practices	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105213	Becoming Agile in an Imperfect World	Taking a big bang approach to Agile is not a viable option for most organizations. Most successful adoptions of Agile are tailored to the strengths and limitations of the organization. This workshop will show you how to design a tailored roadmap to becoming Agile, despite the constraints around you. The roadmap includes 3 phases; Getting Ready, Piloting and Spreading Agile. If you're just starting your agile transition or in a transition stage, this workshop will equip you with practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process without starting from scratch.	Adoption	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105990	Agile's Ultimate Success Lies Outside The Development Team	A sign that Agile has gone mainstream is the expanding discussion of how it affects groups outside the development team. Since Agile seeks to improve both the creation and delivery of value, other groups (marketing, sales, executive management, etc.) are necessarily part of the Agile experiment. However, many Agile teams struggle with these "downstream" consequences.\n\nThis 180-minute session will take a workshop approach to this topic. Through a combination of discussion and exercises, we will identify, simulate, and address the core issues of Agile's effects beyond the development team.	Business Transformation	Invited Tutorial	2010
20108616	Clojure, up-front and personal: The Orbit Kata	In this three-hour session you will learn Clojure by following along with Uncle Bob, step by step, and test-case by test-case, as you build a simple Swing/Clojure orbital simulator app. Along the way youâ€™ll learn the value of Functional Programming, how (and why!) to design applications that use it, and why Clojure is the next important language that you should master.\n\nThis session will be extremely challenging! Plan on requiring an hour or so of down-time to allow your neuronal excitation to exponentially decay to safe levels. 	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105860	How We Do Things Around Here In Order to Succeed	The path an Agile roll-out should follow depends on the core culture of the corporation: control, competence, collaboration or cultivation. Irrespective of the specific culture, the Agile roll-out invariably tests cultural integration, wholeness and balance. It exposes inconsistencies between approach to customers versus approach toward other constituencies such as partners and employees. \n\nTo create and capture lasting value, the Agile initiative must be linked to a coherent corporate culture. This workshop holds the details you need to know about how to forge this critical link.\n	Adoption	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105302	Whither Agile? A Participant-Driven Round Table	When a breakthrough idea crosses the chasm it passes through a make-or-break stage of maturation. Without leadership, even the best ideas can evaporate into nothingness or ossify into dogmatism. Agile stands at just such a turning point now. The message has become fragmented, diluted, co-opted for profit, mischaracterized, abused, and attached as a label to just about anything. What can the community do to see that the proven value of agile principles and practices is not lost in the general chaos or surrendered to commercial interests that have a branded, packaged solution to sell?	Adoption	Invited Tutorial	2010
20106362	Scaling Up by Scaling Down: A (re)Focus on Individual Skills	Have you ever seen a successful pilot of agile techniques followed by miserable failure in wider adoption or scaling?\n\nThe current focus for scaling Agile seems to be on practices, process, and tools. I assert that the success of any Agile adoption effort depends first on the individuals, their interpersonal and self-leadership skills, and the organization's support of these skills. \n\nLast year's session on this topic is at: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/scaling-up-by-scaling-down.\nThis year's session has significant new material and exercises.	Building High Performance Teams	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105624	Software Craftsmanship Practices	How does one become a Master Craftsman?  Practice, practice, practice.  In this workshop we will get our hands dirty exploring some of the more common techniques for practicing the software craft.  We will perform code katas, working on sense of code smell, do some randori, and more.  Bring your laptop and prepare for a mental workout.  You will learn exercises that you can use to train yourself at home and teach your colleagues.\n\n	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105928	The Incentive Trap	In the majority of cases, Agile is introduced into an existing environment. The way in which projects are delivered starts to change, but often the successful realisation of the full benefits of Agile are impeded by causes that are not immediately obvious, or considered material.\n\nIn our experience, the manner by which an organisation chooses to reward and incentivise can have unexpected and unintended consequences.\n\nRather than preaching, or theorising we aim to allow attendees to experience for themselves the end results of different incentive schemes and draw their own conclusions.	Business Transformation	Invited Tutorial	2010
20106239	Blueprint for an Agile Enterprise: Plans, Tools&Tech to Build a Human Enterprise	Want your whole organization to be more like an Agile team? Starting teams is well understood; expanding Agile to the organization is definitely not. Using 8 years experience applying organization development to Agile, we'll unfold a 7 layer organizational architecture for building a human enterprise. Each level has an overall perspective, specific tools and key practices. Part tutorial, part demo, we'll create a change plan for one participant's organization, exploring culture, leadership, change, team performance, and management's role. You'll leave with a plan template and many ideas.	Organization & Enterprises	Invited Tutorial	2010
20108587	Evolutionary development for the web with ASP.NET MVC and TDD	This 3-hour course will teach you how to approach web development from an agile perspective. You will learn techniques for rapidly developing small, incremental vertical features in an application in order to deliver maximum value in a minimum amount of time. You will learn to start with the high level specifications for feature completeness, expressed in an automated acceptance test, and then implementing the logical functionality with Test-Driven Development.\n\nThe course will be taught using Visual Web Developer 2010, ASP.NET MVC 2, xUnit.net, and SpecFlow.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105663	Continuous Delivery	Businesses need to deliver valuable new features to users as frequently as possible in order to make money. But they need to make sure releases are stable and well-tested. In this tutorial we discuss how to deliver features rapidly and reliably through an automated build, deploy, test and release pattern called the deployment pipeline. In this tutorial we take the unique approach of moving from release back through testing to development practices, analyzing at each stage how to improve collaboration and increase feedback so as to make the delivery process as fast and efficient as possible.

20105963	Feeding the Agile Beast: Improving Business Value Delivered	Agile delivers improved fit, throughput, visibility and transparency, and collaboration. But the need within most organizations is not just improved software development - it is to improve the ability to deliver value. Software development organizations must focus on the initiatives where there is the greatest potential return.  This is an introduction to Capability Analysis - a proven method of maximizing economic outcomes by laser focusing development on delivery of business value. Unlike many Business Analysis techniques, it matches the cadence and needs of the Agile team.	Business Transformation	Invited Tutorial	2010
20106341	Help me see it: Using collaborative sketching to bring product ideas to life	Agile projects seem to start in a big rush. In trying to avoiding big design up front, teams miss the opportunity to imagine the great things their product could be.\n\nIn this action-packed hands-on tutorial you'll learn a simple practice for collaboratively identifying great product UI ideas. You'll learn several different ways to envision your user's experience. Then armed with only a product backlog, pencil and paper, you'll go to work sketching product ideas. After synthesizing your team's ideas, you'll see the real power of ideation in helping great product ideas emerge quickly.    \n	UX/UI	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105529	Agile Estimating & Planning: From Basics to Brain Stumpers	Planning is important yet many teams view planning as something to avoid and many companies use plans as weapons against their teams. In this session you'll learn how to break that cycle with skills that create useful plans that lead to reliable decisions. After mastering the basic concepts, we will progress quickly to planning under complex situations including how to estimate velocity without historical data, how to estimate velocity when team size is changing, and how to create confidence intervals so we can create plans we are 90% confident in, even on fixed-price or fixed-date contracts	Project Management	Invited Tutorial	2010
20108615	How to increase your effectiveness by using Lean, Kanban and Real Options	One of the newer approaches to emerge in the agile community is Kanban. Kanban is based on many of the same principles that are the foundation of Lean. By combining this with the ideas from Real Options a powerful way of dealing with decisions, uncertainty and risk management emerges. A framework that allows you to focus on effectiveness.\n\nThis session covers the basics of Lean, Kanban and Real Options, how and where to use them and why you would bother. Attending this session will change the way you view the world. It will never be the same again.	Organization & Enterprises	Invited Tutorial	2010
20105994	 A Non-Software Scrum Experience: Scrum-But or Context-Sensitive?	Nonstandard Scrum techniques have evolved in a non-software team at a manufacturing client preparing business process changes in Customer Care for a new product line. The team is operating successfully, but in some ways far from received wisdom of Scrum "best practices."\n\nA network of subteams of varying headcount, the team operates on partially overlapping backlogs. Yesterday's weather & next sprint's capacity are assessed down to the individual level because of persistent specialization among team members. \n\nDo we have Scrum-But (or worse!) or a set of defensible adaptations?	Business Transformation	Talk	2010
20106426	The Power of the Idea	The transformative power of the idea establishes purpose, creates energy, and focuses the creative and generative capacity of an organization to accomplish its goals.  What is this "idea"?  It is the core of what it is that the organization is about.  In addition to driving business, alignment with the idea guides successful adoption of new concepts such as Agile.  Organizations that know what their idea is can dominate their market.  This workshop helps participants identify their organization's idea and how to use this idea to successfully navigate the complex and competitive marketplace.	Business Transformation	Workshop	2010
20106370	Has Anything Changed?	Marketing talks about backlogs and product owners. Developers talk about CI, TDD, standup meetings, and user stories. Operations talks about lean. But has anything really changed across the business? Do we produce real value faster?\n\nThrough a series of group exercises, we will identify issues preventing progress in your organization, hear others' solutions to them, and explore how you can apply those solutions to your environment. Come to this session ready to collaborate. Bring your challenges. Most important, come prepared to work as if the solution depends entirely on you. \n	Business Transformation	Workshop	2010
20106415	Learning Agile at Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare, One Step at a Time	When Harvard Pilgrim started down the path to using Agile principles, their goal seemed so distant as to be unattainable. The plan called for simultaneously implementing a new process, replacing most of their core applications with systems, some entirely new to the market, and implementing a service oriented architecture. With so much to change at once, they began a series of incremental steps to achieve these outcomes. This experience report walks through several hard earned lessons regarding implementing Agile rapidly within a large organization.	Enterprise Improvement	Talk	2010
20105186	Agile Test Automaton Strategy for the Non-Technical	Agile leaders need to understand the critical role test automation plays in achieving agility. Do we really need automated unit tests? Why? And how about system / functional / story tests? What role do they play? Who should write them, and when? How do we earn back the cost of all this test automation? And how do we do it if we have a lot of legacy code?  This tutorial answers these questions in terminology the typical non-coding manager, architect or tester can understand. It also lays out several test automation strategies and points out their strengths and weaknesses.	Enterprise Improvement	Tutorial	2010
20106380	Mapping the Agile Enablement Battlefield	Most agile initiatives focus solely on delivery and execution while ignoring the impact that such a radical change will have on an organization.  It is the responsibility of the SM to shield the team from such distractions rather than leverage them as enablement tools.  Via a military metaphor, we use a simple technique of mapping influences acting on projects.  Mapping is used to analyze the organization to identify potential risks and decide where to exert influence to make the difference between the beginning of an agile transformation and the end of a single agile project.	Leadership & Culture	Tutorial	2010
20105952	Are We Done YET?!	Are we done yet?\nMany teams new to Agile struggle with how to know when their story or feature is complete. We introduce the importance of Acceptance Criteria and the Definition of Done. Why is it important to the Product Owner and the Delivery team? In this economy we want to make sure we are building the right thing!\nThe key concepts of the game are: \nVelocity \nDoneness - Definition of Done\nSelf Organizing Teams and Roles\nTime-boxed\nRetrospective\nThe game is a hands on stress free way to learn. There will be lots of laughing, come join the fun!\n	Expressing User Needs	Workshop	2010
20105516	Improving Customer Conversations	It's not easy to build the right product. People don't always know exactly what they need, want things that won't help, and don't imagine what's possible. Further, most people aren't born with the ability to speak naturally in user stories or concise requirements statements. So we must learn how to ask the right questions, draw out pertinent information and understand our customer's world.\n\nThis session explores how to make the most of questions:  different types of questions, when to use each, and signs that you need to probe deeper. 	Expressing User Needs	Other	2010
20105767	Life's not a Beach, it's a Game: Innovation GamesÂ® for Agile Teams	One of the most important decisions a team can make is deciding what features it wants to deliver, and when to deliver them. Delivering the wrong features too early can lead to failure and delivering them too late, or for the wrong market segment, can lead to a competitive disadvantage and lost sales. In this hands-on workshop, Cory and Luke will show you how to use collaborative play with customers to discover how they think and what they value, and use this information to effectively prioritize and release the features they want - when they want them.	Expressing User Needs	Tutorial	2010
20105680	Product Owner as Agile Leader - Oxymoron or Critical Success Factor	One of the more crucial roles in agile teams is that of XP Customer or Scrum Product Owner. These are pervasive roles, with aspects that are often debated. Are they part of the team or not? Does their neck get wrung or not? Are they outward focused or inward focused? Do they serve as a leadership voice within the team or not? In this presentation we'll explore the role of the Agile Product Owner from a role and responsibility (or focus) perspective with an eye towards leadership. Perhaps we'll find the true north between the titles two polar opposites.	Product Management	Talk	2010
20105530	The biggest bang for the buck! Strategies to organize & prioritize your backlog	Selecting and delivering the most important work is a critical success factor in Agile projects. But how do you know what is important? Unless you are psychic, some help would come in handy.\n\nGet a guided tour to a variety of strategies and tools to manage your backlog. Understand the benefits of each approach using a model that puts them in context; learn how to make informed decisions on which to use in your situation. E.g. Innovation GamesÂ®, Story Map, Software By Numbers, Kano Analysis.\n\nA series of hands-on exercises will help ground your understanding so come ready to play!	Product Management	Tutorial	2010
20106319	Product Management, Agile and Customer Development	The greatest cause of failure for new product introductions is not product development (i.e., the product), but in the development of customers and markets. \n\nCustomer Development is about discovering and learning who your customers are. It's a parallel process to Product Development only that it is customer and market centric.  \n\nSession participants can expect an introduction to Customer Development and how the essential roles of Product Management and Agile Development combine to minimize product/market risk. 	Product Management	Talk	2010
20106109	Building a More Accurate Burndown: Using Range Estimation in Scrum	Traditional Scrum burndowns are based on single point estimates of how long a task will take.  However, single point estimates are inherently faulty and inaccurate, and they encourage underestimation.  Learn how to incorporate range based estimation techniques into your Scrum burndown, and better communicate to your boss or clients what a project is really going to take.  Arin will back up this thesis with academic and industry research, real world examples, and an engaging presentation style.  Participants will leave with concrete tips & templates for using range estimates in their projects.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20105873	Scrum and Kanban - Like Chocolate and Peanut Butter	You may have heard that Scrum and Kanban are mutually exclusive or that Kanban isn't good for large software projects. In fact, much as Scrum and XP play well together, so do Scrum and Kanban.\n\nThis session is for folks that are already doing Scrum and are curious about Kanban. It will show how the Lean practice of "One Piece Flow"is the key to both, and look at how to mix and match Scrum and Kanban to fine tune a process that fits your circumstances. This will include: decoupling once-per iteration activities from the iteration, work-in-progress limits, and the concept of "pull."\n	Project Management	Workshop	2010
20105900	Fixed-Bid, Fixed-Feature, Fixed-Time Agile Development	Many people think that agile development is for open-ended, ambiguously-defined, projects - but not for fixed-price, fixed-time, fixed-feature ones. Nothing could be further from the truth! I have seen successful agile fixed-price contracts for over 25 years, and believe that agility is required for fixed-price to succeed. I have learned many lessons: some of them bad, most of them good. In this talk I present some guidance about how to do these projects successfully: how the organization works in an agile way; how to develop a strategy for the project; and how to monitor its progress.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20106287	Avoiding Mediocrity in Agile Adoptions	Understand why learning is the largest part of software development and why many Agile teams fail.  If your practices do not enhance individual and team learning you are probably cargo-culting Agile (going through the motions without receiving the intended value).  Agile is all about recognizing and responding to change effectively.  Unfortunately many of us recognize problems and respond ineffectively because it is painful to face the truth that we are part of the problem.\n\nAttend to learn to understand the magnitude of this problem, how to recognize it, and how to begin to address it.	Adoption	Tutorial	2010
20105907	The Lean Pyramid - The Equilibrium of Agile Forces 	The Lean Pyramid presents a concept to help companies start their agile adoption strategy effectively. Reliably delivering valuable working software frequently is much more than just creating, estimating and prioritizing a backlog and developing it iteratively. In order to succeed with agile you have to understand the needed equilibrium of forces among strategy, management and engineering efforts. Through a deep explanation of the fundamental Lean principles, you will learn how they translate to agile software development in order to create a strong and successful culture in your company. \n	Adoption	Tutorial	2010
20106368	Management for the Agile Age - Stewardship and Partnership for Agile Teams	Many enterprise agile transitions run into the same serious impediment - an inability to manage and govern in a way consistent with agile values. Many managers struggle to define their role in an agile organization. This thought-provoking session explores why conventional management approaches are fundamentally incompatible with self-organizing teams, and proposes specific steps for redefining the boss-worker relationship and evolving our organizational structures. We'll also tackle the issues of job classifications, performance evaluations and compensation in an agile environment.\n	Adoption	Talk	2010
20105153	How the Underdog Outperformed the Champ	We all want to be part of a team that is producing high quality software as fast as we can.  Technical knowledge and experience of the team can help but this experience can also hinder a team that wants to deliver each iteration.\n\nThis session will tell you about a large team divided into sub-teams and how the 2 teams with less technical experience produced more features each iteration faster.  These teams did this with better quality and less rework as well.  It was a phenomenon that surprised me at first.  The session will cover what the numbers showed and the behaviors that lead to them.	Building High Performance Teams	Experience report	2010
20105978	Improving Decision Making in Your Agile Team	In an agile environment, the development team is empowered to make most decisions, creating a "pluralist decision making environment."Team members are faced with decision tasks on a daily basis in a dynamic environment with rapidly changing requirements, expectations, and underlying data. Therefore, this workshop's participants will discuss key decisions an agile team makes; share best practices for decision strategies and methods of data presentation to support high quality decision making in agile IS projects; and provide an overview of contemporary mechanisms to evaluate decisions.	Building High Performance Teams	Workshop	2010
20106143	That Baby Is Ugly: Protecting Naysayers and Guarding Quality on HPTs	Sometimes you just have to call the baby ugly - that is hard to do when the baby belongs to you - or your team.  However, an objective view reveals that software product is in distress, features are getting less and less stable at each release, the user hasn't been considered, but the team wants to stay positive. \n\n	Building High Performance Teams	Workshop	2010
20105198	Retrospective for an agile coach	What does an agile coach actually do?\nHow does context affect what works and what doesn't?\n\nIn this session we reflect both on the big picture of a number of agile coaching assignments and on some of the detailed interventions including activities that relate to the team and those impacted such as managers and business stakeholders.\n\nIn the true spirit of retrospectives both success and failure are considered with the intention of looking for opportunities to improve.\n\nAttendees will be asked to consider how they might deal with particular scenarios and learn lessons from my mistakes.	Coaching Agile	Talk	2010
20105279	Effective questions for an agile coach	An agile coach is typically an experienced expert. He has a solution for everything. In many cases, good advices without client's ownership will not lead to real change. Sometimes it may be wiser to abstain from giving direct advice and ask questions instead.\nIn this workshop the participants will learn why use questions when coaching and how to make them effective.  We will practice making great questions that increase coachee's awareness and help him find solutions himself.\nWe will also present a clear model of how to proceed  from a problem to improvement using questions.\n\n	Coaching Agile	Workshop	2010
20105307	Behaviour Driven Development for Life	BDD is a Lean toolset that encompasses the whole software lifecycle. In BDD we define goals at varying levels of granularity, talk through the definition with stakeholders, explore contexts to produce different outcomes, and break down large goals into smaller sub-goals for quick learning. With a few additional tools from coaching, NLP and Real Options, these patterns can be applied to real life - and it's also a fun way to practice the BDD mindset.\n\nThis talk introduces the non-technical principles of full-stack BDD together with a few simple examples, so is suitable for beginners.	Coaching Agile	Talk	2010
20105246	Pinocchio: On Becoming a Lean Leader 	You're a mischievous wooden little boy who dreams of becoming a manager one day. On your journey, you'll encounter characters that will lead you astray and others who'll help you find your way back to your goal.\n\nDiscover how you can apply some Lean Leadership tools:\n  \n * Long term philosophy\n * Focus on Value\n * Relentless Reflection and Continuous Improvement\n * Leadership Discipline\n * Decisions based on Consensus\n\nJoin us to put some Lean leadership tools into practice and come up with 3 actions to take away. Give your story a Happy Ending with the help of talking animals. 	Leadership & Culture	Workshop	2010
20105110	Collaborating with Non-Collaborators	How can we deal with non-collaborators? We can't change them but we might be able to work with them - or, work around them. How do we know? In this interactive course, you will learn how to identify non-collaborators, understand the systems your non-collaborators work in, assess the systems you work in, build a map of traits, and map tools for dealing with non-collaborators.	Leadership & Culture	Workshop	2010
20105565	Upstream Kanban: Engineering to Marketing	This is the story of a value-driven transformation, about how groups from Product Management, Marketing and Engineering merged into a single organization and reporting line, and a single Kanban team that embraces the entire value flow, from concept to final delivery. We improved work flow and hand-offs, end-to-end visibility and communication, and achieved new levels of responsiveness, with work capacity up by two-thirds and visibility up 200%. We'll relate a detailed account of our experience, and the tools and metrics we used to drive participation, improvement and inclusion.	Organization & Enterprises	Talk	2010
20105533	Comparative Agility: How Agile You Are and How Agile is the Industry	Are you curious how agile your organization is? Do you wonder how you compare with other organizations? Comparative Agility is framework for assessing organizational agility.  Over 1,500 participants worldwide have taken the assessment survey.  We will describe how to use the tool and how to derive actionable information from survey results. We will present industry findings derived from assessment results.  Attendees will gain insight through small group discussions during which they will interpret industry-wide results and develop actionable advice based upon results of a real company.	Organization & Enterprises	Tutorial	2010
20105383	Today's best practice is tomorrow's process smell	The premise: A "best practice" at one level of maturity becomes a "process smell" that guides us to the next level of maturity. There is a tendency to "lock in" a set of assumptions and practices and to assume this represents "agile best practice." Rather than locking in, we should be guided by the principle, "question everything." This applies especially to our own assumptions about what constitutes agile best practice. Otherwise, our thinking will ossify and we will cease to improve the overall agile toolkit and our own ability to add value for customers.	Organization & Enterprises	Other	2010
20106245	Cooking the Product Stew	What is a stew? A stew is made from various ingredients you have around, left overs, new ingredients that go together well, and others that are filling but need lots of sauce. The enterprise software market is made up of products that are a stew of software on many legacy platforms that have evolved over a long period by many hands. Taking an enterprise software product to Agile methods is a challenge. In a uniquely European context, this presentation will draw from the ongoing agile adoption in a multi-location multi-team enterprise product with 460 staff in 4 countries and 5 locations.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Talk	2010
20106229	Generating Actionable Solutions using Distributed Retrospectives	Distributed development challenges the effectiveness of retrospectives.We designed and trialled a lightweight analytical approach (CLPP-Retro) that engages distributed teams and generates actionable solutions. We discuss the feedback from a team that employed CLPP-Retro over 12 iterations. They find that it identifies solutions that are not merely corrective; it facilitates agile adoption, identifies critical gaps in the organization, improves estimation, decreases repetitive problems, and provides a voice for the engineer. We also discuss lessons learned during deployment.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Workshop	2010
20105734	Applying Agile Development Practices to Distributed Teams	For a distributed team it is even more important to pay 'Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design' as the Agile Manifesto requests. Yet, how to implement the typical agile development practices like pair programming or collective code ownership in a distributed setting? Moreover are there any differences or things to watch out for when applying "easier"practices like unit testing or refactoring? In this session I want to focus on the impact and application of agile development practices in distributed teams and how such a team can ensure its technical excellence.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Workshop	2010
20106310	Agile Business Intelligence - 12 Critical Steps to Success	The data community is one of the next "agile frontiers". While the software community has largely embraced agile techniques, data warehousing practitioners continue to follow a waterfall development style, and continue to have a high probability of project struggles or outright failures. It can be challenging to apply agile software practices directly to BI systems development. This includes technical practices; project management practices; and "customer"interaction practices. This talk demonstrates the key practices that are especially tailored to the nuances of data warehousing.	Team-Room Agile	Talk	2010
20105589	Exploring the Kanban Multiverse	A multiverse is the hypothetical set of multiple possible universes that together comprise everything that physically exists: space, time, matter, energy, momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. A Kanban Multiverse is the hypothetical set of multiple possible Kanban Boards that together comprise everything that physically could be visualised: scope, time, work type, status, flow, and the organisational laws and constants that govern them. This workshop will explore how a single Kanban Board might visualise these multiple aspects in a limited and constrained space.	Team-Room Agile	Workshop	2010
20105208	It's All In the Cards	The hallmarks of a "good"story card are that it describes business value, can be estimated, and can be tested.  When I'm asked how to write good story cards,  I typically answer, "You start by writing a couple hundred bad ones."Like all things, it takes practice to improve. There are, however, ways to write better story cards from the start.  This session will explore the good, the bad, and the ugly of story card writing using examples from real projects and will give participants an opportunity to exercise their story writing skills for their own projects.	Team-Room Agile	Tutorial	2010
20106170	Walk and Code - Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis	Life as a programmer is primarily sedentary.  Most of the day, a programmer sits in front of a computer moving little more than fingers. \n\nDr. Jame Levine of the Mayo Clinic has been doing some fascinating research on the health benefits of non-exercise activity.  He has pioneered the concept of active workstations to promote an overall healthier life for people with typically sedentary jobs.  I have taken his advice to heart and built a walking treadmill desk that I use everyday as I write code.   I will present Dr. Levine's research and report on my first 6 months on the treadmill desk.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Experience report	2010
20106296	Programmer Self-Education: My Year Studying Programming Language Fundamentals	After attending Michael Feathers's talk at SCNA 2009 titled "Self-Education and the Craftsman," Kevin Taylor made a commitment to himself to read the revered, and despised, MIT textbook, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP). Over the next year, he spent hours each week working through challenging programming exercises in Lisp.\n\nIn this talk, Kevin shares some of the programming fundamentals he discovered, or rediscovered. Kevin also shares his insights on the importance of self-education (knowledge + practice) for software craftsmen and their journey toward mastery.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Experience report	2010
20106353	The Butterfly Effect - How the little things you do affect you later	The butterfly effect is a phrase from chaos theory that describes how a dynamic system can be very sensitive to changes in the initial conditions. As the story goes, a butterfly flaps its wings in Maine and causes a hurricane in India that floods millions from their homes. Software systems, and in particular the systems we call "teams" and "processes" are very similar and are also subject to the same kind of unexpected outcomes. How do changes to processes, rules, guidelines and gates impact the work the team does? How does it impact the thing they produce?	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Talk	2010
20105488	How Low Can You Go: Doing the Defect Management Limbo	In the party game Limbo, you set a bar lower and lower. Players must dance under the bar without touching the floor. When it comes to bugs, we also want to set the bar lower - fewer bugs are better. How do we do that, and what about our huge defect queue? Lean development tells us queues are waste, but don't we need defect tracking systems (DTS)? \n\nWe'll discuss different approaches to bugs, from "fix and forget"to lightweight DTS. We'll look what we can learn from bugs, including Antony Marcano's "hidden backlog"concept. We'll explore agile ways to prevent bugs.\n	Testing/Specification Practices	Talk	2010
20105834	Testing When You're Not Automated (Yet)	Ideally, as an Agile tester you would enjoy full participation of customers and programmers in creating automated acceptance tests for every feature before it's coded, and manual regression testing would be a thing of the past. For many reasons, this is not often the case. How do you balance releasing rapidly with adequate testing, especially when you're dealing with an existing product with few or no automated tests? In this tutorial you'll practice simple, proven techniques for quickly getting control of manual testing on an Agile project, while making time for learning and improvements.	Testing/Specification Practices	Tutorial	2010
20106295	Practices in the Integration of Agile and UCD Processes - A Reality Check	In this experience report I discuss the investigations I made into current attempts to address usability & user experience requirements within agile projects. I have conducted in-depth, one-to-one interviews involving 14 participants from 5 different countries. The data collected were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. These interviews covered a broad range of issues ranging from usability and UX goals, to incorporating user feedback in UI implementations within an agile team.	UX/UI	Experience report	2010
20106294	Mind the Gap	This report will summarise experiences across a number of projects, customers and teams where there was a significant UCD aspect to the projects.  It will explore where teams worked efficiently, not so efficiently or were down right dysfunctional.  This will highlight each of the team's key challenges, what made their approach successful or hi-light warnings for future projects.  A common issue that each of these teams highlighted were extremities on the gap between UX and development collaboration and understanding.	UX/UI	Experience report	2010
20106290	Using storytelling to explore the rich context of user experience	We all tell stories-they are an easy way to communicate. Agile uses Stories as a core technique to explore needs and benefits for each unit of work. This workshop will look at complementary ways to use storytelling and stories to add depth to the team's understanding of the rich context of user experience. These types of stories help you understand users, add perspective and context to personas, and explore early design ideas. This hands-on workshop will explore additional ways to use stories to keep the big picture in view.	UX/UI	Tutorial	2010
20106461	Make Stuff People can Use	There doesn't have to be tension between user experience methodologies and teams working to deliver fast, value-added iterations. Any agile team member can participate in delivering great user experiences without slowing work. Engaging the full agile team in keeping users central to their thinking is the best way to successfully incorporate emergent requirements and provide innovative and usable experiences. This active session illustrates how user-centric gains can be made with a few activities that activate user empathy and provide enhanced ability to provide deliverables for users' needs.	UX/UI	Talk	2010
20105951	Agile Teams: Surprising Exceptions to Common Expectations	Agile teams tend to work better when they exhibit certain qualities, competencies and behaviors. Conversely, teams are much less effective when they exhibit other traits that run counter to Agile expectations. Or so the literature says... But is that the complete picture?\n\nDuring this workshop participants will identify and consolidate factors that enabled the challenged, imminent-failure teams to succeed, as well as the factors that inhibited potentially great teams. These lessons will assist them on future teams and integrate real-world experience into the Agile body of knowledge.	Leadership & Culture	Workshop	2010
20105756	Agile Managers: The Essence of Leadership	As organizations have transitioned to agile projects and programs, what happens to the managers? Do we need managers any more? Yes, we need managers. And, in an agile organization, where the managers are freed from the day-to-day tactical project tasks, we need them more than ever as  leaders doing strategic work: managing the project portfolio, removing organizational obstacles, building trusting relationships with technical staff, coaching, providing feedback, assisting with career development, leading the hiring decisions and process, and building the capacity of the organization.\n	Leadership & Culture	Talk	2010
20105612	Trust, Authenticity & Forgiveness: Workplaces Where People Thrive & Produce	Trust is a key ingredient for collaborative work. Yet even when things go wrong, the team must recover to remain productive. As team members we must trust, learn to forgive, and move forward when trust needs rebuilding. Taking a look at the origins and the behavioral components of trust - including the individual propensity to trust (or distrust), we'll build a foundation for discovering the role of trust and forgiveness in teams. We'll also explore why a clearer understanding of interpersonal behavior across gender and other differences can lead to mistrust or accelerate trust building.	Building High Performance Teams	Tutorial	2010
20106207	Agile for the Practical Project Manager 	In this 60 minute presentation, we will provide a 360 degree view of Agile and how it relates to the classic project manager role. We will discuss the flavors of Agile, how to pick and choose practices from the flavors, and how to create an Agile lifecycle that thrives within a specific company and environment. We will look at the overall Project Management lifecycle and where Agile fits in. We will also discuss the Scrum Master role and how it can be done in parallel with classic PM work.  This presentation has been presented to over 1000 project managers to superb reviews.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20105801	Agreeing on Business Value Using Systems Thinking 	Defining value, reasoning why those values matter and figuring out how a project will deliver that value is crucial to a project's success. One of the results we've seen consistently is higher value, for less cost.\n\nSo why do so few projects define and measure the values they were created to achieve? Because agreeing on values with diverse stakeholders is hard.\n\nExperience how to build business value models based on business value drivers to determine what's really needed. See how the models help you achieve our projects' goals. Learn how you can help define and deliver value.	Business Transformation	Tutorial	2010
20106250	From Estimate to Contract - Choosing the Right Model for Your Situation	Because we work within a variety of industries, including medical and defense, we use several different contracting models.  In any particular scenario, more than one model could work.  This talk will discuss how to select the right model and go from estimates to a cooperative contracting model that fits the situation.  It will also explore methods for properly accounting for risk.  Finally, it will look at ways to best present the information to a client so that they clearly understand options available. 	Business Transformation	Talk	2010
20106069	Using Agile and Lean to Lead Business Transformation	Companies need a sustainable model for leading continuous change - yet most leadership teams are too busy running the business to effectively lead change.  Many transformation efforts fail due to false starts, organizational resistance, and a lack of effective governance. We will explore a strategic change project management model that has repeatedly resulted in successful ongoing change initiatives. The model draws on Agile and Lean principles and techniques to lead change initiatives in a way that is simple, provides focus and transparency, and builds trust. 	Business Transformation	Talk	2010
20106053	Hiring doesn't have to be random	Agile teams need to hire. How do you know who will transform your entire team's ability to meet its objectives?\n\nBehavorial Interviewing is a very pragmatic technique that gets to heart of assessing people. Avoid typical mistakes like hiring people similar to you ("fit"). Get good information from people who do not interview well, and don't get blinded by those who do. Focus on the specific traits you need in your team, rather than just skills.\n\nThrough experience as interviewers, your team will also greatly enhance their understanding of each other, and collaborate more effectively.

20105740	RIM's Agile story, the Millionaire game show	The style of the presentation will be a Millionaire game show format guiding the audience through the history of Agile at RIM by answering progressively more challenging multi-choice questions for each milestone of the narrative.\n\nEach question will be introduced with a summary of the milestone context, and the audience will be asked to predict the next step.  Wry humor will keep both novice and Agilista amused and engaged.  The audience will wait with baited breath as with suspense and drama the answer is revealed, and the next stage of the 'RIM Agile story' is fleshed out with visuals.	Enterprise Improvement	Other	2010
20105116	Agile Transitions: Cannonball and Stealth Approaches Exposed/Compared	You've discovered agile and are excited!  You are a leader within your team or company.  Your next question is "How do I ignite this fire and get agile to take root in my organization?"\n\nAfter experiencing two extreme opposite transitions, I will tell the story of these approaches along with their successes, failures, and lessons learned.  One transition occurred in a regulated global 50 company including offshore teams which dove headfirst into Scrum and XP within 3 months.  The second is a stealth transition in a small .com startup company that is still ongoing after 3 years.	Adoption	Talk	2010
20106161	Bloody Stupid Johnson Teaches Agile	This fun and energetic session features "Bloody Stupid" Johnson and The Jester facing off to architect the Perfect Agile Process (PAP). On their journey, they will get just about everything wrong. Come learn what not to do and have a good time doing it.	Leadership & Culture	Talk	2010
20106323	Becoming Agile: Designing a Transition Plan from Waterfall to Agile	An increasing number of organizations are transitioning to Agile, but designing a compelling transition plan to secure executive support can be intimidating. This interactive session will take participants through a fictional business case in which the purpose is to design a plan to transfer an organization from traditional Waterfall to Agile. The class will discuss the case and break into groups to analyze the situation. The case will then be 'solved' as a class, integrating each group's findings to design a successful high-level transition plan.\n\n	Enterprise Improvement	Tutorial	2010
20105528	The Right Way to Wireframe	What happens when you take 4 designers, give them all the same design problem and challenge them to come up with a solution and document their entire process? \n\nThis highly interactive panel takes a detailed behind the scene look at their process, including: research, IA/interaction design, wireframing/prototyping and visual design. Each presentation will wrap up with a time-lapse video of their entire process from start to finish. 	Expressing User Needs	Panel	2010
20106364	Beyond Sprint 0: Using Collaborative Product Discovery to Plan Agile Projects	In this class you'll learn the mechanics of collaborative product discovery: a short intense collaborative phase that precedes a successful agile project.  Discovery workshops leverage design thinking to move from product idea through to a backlog and development plan.  In this class you'll fill your practice toolbox with dozens of practices to mix and match in a series of discovery workshops that involve stakeholders, users, and the whole team to build your product backlog, envision your product's user experience, estimate development time, and plan successful product releases.  	Expressing User Needs	Tutorial	2010
20106374	Is It Time to Ditch Your Product Backlog? Using Story Maps to Visualize Backlogs	Agile teams are asked to build product backlogs, but little guidance is given on how to organize them. Many teams utilize simplistic formats for their backlogs, but often lose the strategic vision in the lists of stories. Ironically, the same teams use very effective visual task board formats for their iteration backlogs. What would the task board equivalent be for product backlogs? The answer is - Story Maps! In this session, learn the key concepts of Story Maps and how they visually present multi-faceted product backlogs. We'll work through a hands-on exercise building an actual story map.\n	Expressing User Needs	Tutorial	2010
20105566	BDD for Analysis: an Introduction to Feature Injection	Behaviour Driven Development allows analysts, developers and testers to collaborate on a project together, producing well-tested, valuable code. BDD emphasises test-first as a way of learning more about the project. This pattern can be applied to analysis too! We work through some simple exercises and techniques for delivering the stories, features and projects that really matter, and provide developers with a clearer understanding of the value behind stories or features before they start coding.	Expressing User Needs	Workshop	2010
20106302	The Art of the Hackathon	hack-a-thon [hak-uh-thon]: a period of time for which team members are given the freedom to work on whatever they want with few restrictions in an environment where creativity is encouraged.\n\nMost organizations value innovation, but often it's unclear how to build time for creativity into their development cycles. This discussion will focus on practical hackathon implementations, how to run them effectively and what to do with the results. Hackathons are a great way to keep development teams engaged and their energy high so why not let the rest of the company join in on the fun?	Building High Performance Teams	Talk	2010
20106077	Product Road-Mapping using Agile Principles	As agile practices become more prevalent, Product Management divisions face increasing challenges to adapt agile techniques. Most Agile project teams prefer direct collaboration with the strategy makers for decision making over reporting metrics; the reality is that only a few product/portfolio managers are actually capable of paradigm shifts to accommodate this drift. What is needed to make this shift? \nThe paper outlines an agile-enabled framework adopted by the digital division of a publishing house to charter their product roadmap and enable their project team with the "big picture".	Product Management	Talk	2010
20105649	Portfolio Management Done Foolishly	The Motley Fool adopted Scrum as the primary development system across the enterprise in December of 2007.  Shortly afterward, we developed a simple initiative planning system to help feed our teams work that was aligned with our strategy.  In 2010, we launched new portfolio management process that allowed us to better utilize Scrum, as described by Ken Schwaber, for growth initiatives and Kanban, as described by David Anderson and Corey Ladas, for managing KTLO (Keep the lights on) work and other sustaining activities.  This interactive session will describe the framework and our findings.	Product Management	Tutorial	2010
20105187	From Concept to Product Backlog - What Happens Before Iteration 0?	Many agile methodologies assume a customer (or product owner) walks into the room with a swack of money and a pile of story cards and tells the development team to start building the functionality described on the top few cards. This tutorial provides an overview of what needs to go on "behind the scenes" between when a project is conceived and when development can start in earnest. It identifies the artifacts that may need to be produced, whether and when they should be produced, which activities can be used to produce them and who should be involved in those activities.	Product Management	Tutorial	2010
20105821	I'm The Business And Agile Was My Idea	Agile is often traditionally associated as being exclusively applicable to the field of software development. However, non-software development projects can take ownership and use agile values, principles and practices to great effect.\n\nIn this session, I will offer some approaches, techniques and examples for introducing agile into parts of the organisation that traditionally may not have considered it such as central services like finance, HR, marketing, traditional business areas as well as other areas of IT like infrastructure and provide some real-life examples along the way.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20105522	Estimating and Managing Fixed Price Contracts For Agile Projects 	Fixed price contracts written before a project starts lock in a fixed set of deliverables. Agile processes allow the customer to change his mind about those deliverables. In this report, we will describe how our project copes with this dissonance, including how we estimate project scope and write statements of work to allow the flexibility of change. We will also show how we manage the project through the life of the contract to meet real customer needs and the letter of the contract. The session will end with a demonstration of our project estimation process followed by a group discussion.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20106242	Case Study: First Time Implementation of Agile at a NY State Government Agency	Like many IT organizations in state government agencies, NY's Dept. of Transportation primarily used Waterfall.  I implemented the agency's first agile projects.  I was challenged by the agency's unique environment, learned lessons, discovered systemic problems, overcame organizational obstacles and changed misconceptions.  I will discuss what I've learned during this award-winning project and make recommendations for others in bureaucratic companies and agencies.  DOT's projects are moving to agile/scrum and the institution's IT group is incorporating agile into its PM and SDLC methodologies.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20105753	Agile Program Management: Another Approach to Large Projects	Have you ever waited weeks for one piece of functionality to release a large project? Have you been in the situation where the software is waiting for the hardware? Or, where the database admin held up the entire release because his work wasn't coordinated with the feature-based teams?\nProgram management is the art of coordinating several sub-projects to a common objective. Until the parts are assembled into the whole, the parts have no value to the organization. Agile approaches help manage risk for projects, and can scale to programs. We'll experience risk and coordination as a program.	Project Management	Tutorial	2010
20105254	Accelerating Your Organization's Agile Adoption	As more organizations adopt Agile practices they want to rapidly extend these benefits across their enterprise.  However, agile adoption is challenging and teams can often start regressing backwards in the 'J-curve' effect after a few iterations. Using a skills maturity framework, organizations can assess where they are and accelerate their agile adoption avoiding the costs associated with the 'J-curve' effect.   Participants will have an opportunity to practice by measuring their own agile maturity and working through some real-world problem scenarios with their fellow participants.	Adoption	Workshop	2010
20105776	Using Scrum to Complement Existing Organizational Transformation Methods	Like many other large-scale organizations, we have engaged in organizational transformation by using and adapting recognized change management principles.  While relying on John Kotter's eight essential principles led to some dramatic successes, we found that our own inconsistencies in how we engaged stakeholders and demonstrated short-term wins impacted the level of success. In this session, we will discuss how Scrum complements the eight steps of transformation, provide practical guidance in how to leverage Scrum and provide project examples that demonstrated the value of the integration.	Adoption	Talk	2010
20105752	Energize Your Agile Community with Roundtable	Do you remember the energy from the early XP/Agile conferences? Want this same energy in your local community or inside your company? Don't wait for someone else to do it - begin a roundtable today.\n\nStarted by Alistair Cockburn, the Salt Lake Agile Roundtable over 13 years has produced a thriving local Agile community, strong Agile teams at local companies, major Agile conferences, and two Gordon Pask award winners. In this session, you'll see and try the practices that work for us. You'll experience the unique feel of our user group and leave ready to start or re-energize your community.	Adoption	Workshop	2010
20105798	Savoring the spirit of Scrum	Laws are general, concrete but not comprehensive. Thus a judge must interpret it for every trial. Judges interpret by referring both to cases and the spirit of the law. Scrum has a clear and concise definition, but in order to use it in real life we need to interpret it depending on the context. There's the equivalent to case law: case studies and good practices. We'll try to grasp the often forgotten spirit that lives and breathes at the core of any healthy Scrum story. Via interactive activities we'll take a sip of the spirit, absorbing with our souls and bodies the essence of agility.	Adoption	Workshop	2010
20105283	Making feedback work in your teams	One of the key values of XP is Feedback. While teams and software development organisations focus on systemic issues and technical improvements for their Agile journey, the importance of sharing feedback amongst each other somehow falls by the wayside. Feedback in peer groups allows us to rapidly move from forming, storming and norming stages, to performing. On Agile teams that are focussed on communication, this is key to success. In this workshop, I will share with you how we approach feedback at my workplace and explain some of the principles we use to give and receive feedback every day.	Building High Performance Teams	Workshop	2010
20106379	A graphical approach to improve the cost/benefit ratio of user stories	User stories are a great way to capture requirements and are successfully used in many projects. Every user story comes with a business value and a effort needed to implement the story, usually in software. Since there are almost always more requirements than budget (or any other limiting factor like time, available resources, etc) decisions have to be made on  which stories to pick up in which order. Usually the stories are prioritized by the product owner and put on a textual product backlog. We will show how a graphical overview will stimulate the right side of our brains. 	Product Management	Talk	2010
20105942	Getting Managers and Agile Teams Out of Each Other's Hair	One of the most talked about and least well understood concepts in Agile is the "self-managing" team. This session will provide a new perspective on self-management by examining the external roots of the practice and by taking a bottom-up look at what it is, the benefits, and how it works.\n\nWe'll see how twelve widely adopted Agile practices contribute to self-management by reducing and/or redistributing traditional management activities. These practices provide a framework for delegation, communication and coordination; and encourage team ownership, commitment and accountability.	Building High Performance Teams	Talk	2010
20105804	Learning is key to Agile success: Building a learning culture on your Agile team	"Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand." - Chinese Proverb\n\nAgile teams that rapidly learn and apply new-found skills become increasingly adept at embracing change and delivering value. Team members feel more fulfilled, motivated and valued. And they have way more fun!\n\nIn this session you will learn about agile learning! Learn to recognize learning moments and put in place effective learning patterns tuned to your team and context. Learn how to build and sustain an effective learning culture on your agile team.	Building High Performance Teams	Talk	2010
20105243	Lean and Agile: Roommates, Married, or Twins?	What is Lean?  Is Lean the next "big thing" I need to learn -- or is Kanban enough? Is Agile still relevant? To add to the confusion, there seem to be several different interpretations of Lean Thinking in the Agile community! In this panel, four Agile/Lean thought leaders and practitioners will discuss the essential elements of Lean and its relationship to Agile. Our panelists will share their ideas about Lean, show similarities they see between Lean and Agile, and help attendees understand (and perhaps reconcile) any differences.	Organization & Enterprises	Panel	2010
20105643	Coaching Agile Teams: Using Silent Work Techniques to Get to Astonishing Results	The word "respect" tops the list of both the Scrum Values and the XP Values. In both, the agile definition of respect comes through loud and clear: to hear ideas from everyone on the team because diversity of ideas yields astonishing results. Yet, every team I've coached seems divided into two camps - the dominant ones and the quiet ones. Just talking and brainstorming doesn't level the playing field. But "silent work" does. Come to this session to practice techniques you can take home so that your teams become free to create more and better results (faster, too) through silent work.	Coaching Agile	Workshop	2010
20105420	What I learned from burning my parents' house down!	July 1991 Yves` parents go on holiday. Leaving him (19 years old) to guard their house.\n\n1 august 19 hour 36 minutes: Yves' parents house burns down.\n\nIt was yves' fault. And yet it was the best thing that happened to him till 2002. If you want to know why, come to our session. \n \nThis interactive talk will show you why a crisis is a good thing. \nWe make the link to agile transitions and how coaches can use a crisis.\n\nWhy do people change? \nDo we consider their interests when making a change?	Coaching Agile	Talk	2010
20105327	Agile Coaches Dojo	Come to a Dojo for Coaches! Take part in a unique interactive session that builds on the popular Dojo format used by agile developers. Instead of coding problems, we'll be exploring typical challenges faced by an Agile Coach. You get to offer your own counter-moves and also hear how other experienced coaches would tackle the same problem. What you'll see is more that one way to approach coaching that reflects the personal style of each agile coach and their reaction to a given context.	Coaching Agile	Workshop	2010
20105682	The Task Commitment Game	The Task Commitment Game helps team members allocate their time across tasks in an iteration. Designed to be played during the iteration planning meeting, this game specifically helps teams whose members are still working in narrowly defined skill sets. Attendees will play the game as members of a team who don't have enough available hours in the iteration to get all the tasks done. After the game is complete, two additional variations will be shown: an online version for distributed teams from Innovation GamesÂ®, and a minimalist version for the busy or budget-constrained.

20105216	Virtual Reality Meets Scrum: A Senior Team Moves from Management to Leadership	The role of managers in a Scrum organization is a topic of high interest with almost no research. Changes in management roles and behaviors a Scrum environment were evaluated in a rapidly growing, social entertainment and gaming company in Finland. Sulake introduced Scrum in 2006 and within 6 months institutionalized Scrum across the organization. The biggest challenges for managers were keeping up with the team and learning to "let go" and stop micro-managing the teams. The experience of the managers and their transition in roles  and perceptions of the teams will be described in detail.	Leadership & Culture	Talk	2010
20105197	Learning Best Approaches for your Brain	Do you mentor, coach, teach or just help other people? Do you wonder why, after what feels like your greatest teaching moments, some people still don't get it? Neuroscience has started to provide us with insights into what happens in the learner's brain when we're teaching. Learning is really about building and reinforcing existing neural networks. Instead of providing a lot of new ideas out of the blue, we need to understand the learners existing context and work with that. Instead of focusing on mistakes and errors, we need to focus on what good solutions look, sound and feel like.	Leadership & Culture	Workshop	2010
20105662	Death by Scrum Meeting	There is no better way to gauge an organization's culture than to watch its meetings - usually dull and lifeless. Meetings are often cited as one of the most wasteful activities in business - yet Scrum demands more meetings more often. Engineers find themselves micro-managed with little time left to get "real"work done. This session provides leaders a whole new perspective and techniques for Scrum Meetings in building high-performing disciplined teams through focused, active, engaged, visual and time-boxed facilitation techniques to take teams from DOING Scrum to OWNING Scrum!	Leadership & Culture	Tutorial	2010
20105859	A holistic approach to scaling agile at Salesforce.com	Salesforce.com is 100% agile across our 1000 person Technology & Products organization.  Our brand of agile, Adaptive Delivery Methodology (ADM) enables our 100+ teams to collaboratively deliver high quality throughput reliably 3 times a year to more than 67,900 customers worldwide. Scaling while remaining true to agile values is incredibly hard.  In the 3 years since our rollout, we have scaled ADM successfully by approaching scale holistically--considering impacts to people, process and technology.  ADM encourages collaboration and visibility as opposed to centralized control and exclusion.	Organization & Enterprises	Talk	2010
20106233	30 Dev Teams saying: "Bye, bye Scrum. Hello Kanban."	Is your team thinking about moving to Kanban? Do you want to know the benefits and pitfalls you may face? Ultimate Software is knee deep in a large-scale transition to Kanban.  We have moved 200 people (from 30 Scrum teams) to Kanban.  And we have collected over a year's worth of data from every team. These teams didn't just move to Kanban, they have also merged into much larger development teams.  Each team has between 15 and 30 people. In this presentation I'll focus on lessons learned regarding Kanban and large teams. I'll tell you what has and hasn't worked for us.	Organization & Enterprises	Talk	2010
20105628	Achieving Chaords in Organizational Transformation	As teams aspire towards hyper-performance, libraries have materialized to guide teams along their journeys. Unfortunately when results have been good, they have not been reproducible\n\nTeams and the wider organizations that contain them are simply fractal representations of each other: simultaneously of the same design but each with greater complexity. This complexity defines the social fields describing the interrelations between individuals in the organizations. Addressing complexity through channeling social fields, we are able to direct the transformative processes with repeatable chaords	Organization & Enterprises	Workshop	2010
20105600	Scaling Software Agility: Advanced Practices for Large Enterprises	Dean Leffingwell describes how rapidly advancing agile methods are being successfully applied to enterprise-class software development. He describes emerging practices including: lean requirements practices that scale to the full needs of the enterprise, intentionally emergent architectures, achieving strategic alignment and product development flow with the Agile Release Train, a kanban system for re-architecting large-scale systems, and strategies for agile portfolio management.\n\n	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Tutorial	2010
20106210	Mind the Gap! Principles of hyperproductive fully distributed Scrum	The author and Jeff Sutherland previously showed (at Agile2008,2009) Scrum teams using XP practices achieved distributed velocity equal to local velocity with multiple distributed teams. This was shown under extreme timezones and at large scale development.\n\nThe authors have formalized the principles & practices that are the foundation for hyperproductive fully distributed Scrum. This framework has been published as free e-book (SEE ATTACHMENT) and is the subject of this presentation. New experiences and figures on recent projects will be shared to illustrate the pitfalls and success points.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Talk	2010
20106330	Being There Without Being Present: Distributed Teams and UX Design	Experience design is expanding as product development teams disperse. No longer will experience design occur in one open, physical room. Instead, distributed teams will design as well as develop...and they need techniques, guidelines and tools to do so. Development has already become a multishore activity. Yet how do we ensure that distributed teams also incorporate experience design as an integrate part of their approach and outcome?\nThis session provides principles and guidelines to enable teams to design in a collaborative yet distributed fashion.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Talk	2010
20106045	Scaling Scrum -- Practical Techniques for Large Organizations	Have you successfully implemented Scrum on your team, and are hungry to expand?\nAre you finding the pain of scaling your Scrum deployment too much to handle?\nIs the Scrum of Scrums concept not working out the way you thought it would?\nHas someone told you that you need to roll out Scrum to a team of 300+ developers?\nHave you had success with scaling Scrum, and want to share what you've learned with others?\n\nIf so, join us for this interactive session where we explore three different experiences scaling Scrum in large organizations.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Talk	2010
20105217	Scrum Metrics for Hyperproductive Teams: How They Fly Like Fighter Aircraft	Scrum teams use lightweight metrics like story points, the burndown chart, and team velocity. The inventor of Scrum was a fighter pilot and used the burndown chart to help teams land a sprint properly. Recent work with hyperproductive teams shows they are like modern jet fighters in two ways. They have engines that produce velocity--alignment of the team, and team spirit. And they carefully measures aspects of performance to make slight adjustments in flight. Failing to constantly adjust the flight of the team can result in a hyperproductive crash into waterfall performance. \n\n\n	Team-Room Agile	Talk	2010
20105960	Pairing Games as Intentional Practice	Even experienced agile developers sometimes struggle with pair programming. Pairs may have trouble agreeing on a direction, or may find that one person has taken over. Yet specific advice about pair programming is hard to find, and we may not even know which skills we lack.\n\nAs a group, we'll build a model for thinking about pairing skills. Then we'll suggest some games--constrained formats for short pairing sessions--that can act as intentional practice for these skills.  After trying out a few games together, we'll share our experiences and try to invent some new ones.	Team-Room Agile	Talk	2010
20105698	Object-Oriented Design and Mock Objects - for Non-Programmers	We're not shy about saying that testers, programmers, and everyone else in the team needs to become fluent in the business domain. But we're blasÃ© when programming practices and programming knowledge are the exclusive province of the programmers. That hampers communication and hurts teams. \n\nBy simply having people stand up, move around, and speak messages to each other, this workshop will show anyone who attends how advanced object-oriented programming and test-driven design works. \n\nAlthough tailored to non-programmers, programmers may find it useful too.\n\n\n	Team-Room Agile	Workshop	2010
20105167	Agile Architecture Retrospective - Inspect-n-Adapt Tool For The Enterprise	Agile teams perceive architecture-centric approaches as paper-driven, heavyweight, insufficiently focused on business results, and delivering systems that align with standards not relevant in the context of fast changing business challenges.  \nEnterprise architects often criticize Agile methods as they perceive them as lacking architectural control or governance.  \nSoftware Architecture Retrospective is a thinking tool for an enterprise to blend reflections on architecture with agile delivery for balancing quick term business goals with long term architecture initiatives.  	Team-Room Agile	Workshop	2010
20105249	Code Retreat	Code retreats are happening all around the world. What are they? Software craftsmen from all over get together somewhere in the world on a Saturday and do several iterations of pair programming and test-driving Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. For this session, we will only have time for a single iteration, but that should be enough to give you the code retreat fever (and if you catch it, weâ€™ll continue in open space afterward). Please bring your laptop and dev environment of choice.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Workshop	2010
20105816	Developer's Guide to Feedback Driven Development	A new approach for building software has emerged from the world of startups. Steeped with agile and lean principles, these ideas are being championed by Eric Ries, Steve Blank, Dave McClure and others.  Feedback Driven Development, as I am calling it, is one facet of these ideas. As the name implies, we use the interaction of users and their activity to determine if our software is delivering value. This talk will cover what it is, how you use it in the development cycle, explore several implementations and discuss the realities of integration. 	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Talk	2010
20105832	Zero to Clojure in 90 Minutes	We all know that learning one new language a year is a great goal for improvement as an Agile developer who wants to be more effective. However, it can be a bit intimidating to get started in a new language, especially one that looks very different from what you're used to. \n\nMany developers are responding to change (in a macro sense) by learning Clojure, which brings together the expressiveness and power of Lisp, fantastic concurrency semantics, and the rich libraries of Java. It allows for great simplicity of code, which translates to fewer mistakes and more working software.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Tutorial	2010
20106409	How to screw up Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control	Dependency Injection is a technique that has moved out of controversy, but it continues to cause problems when introduced into codebases.  Some consider it a basic principle of good OO design (separating concerns), while others find it makes their code "magical", creates confusing code flow, and obfuscates entry points.  This session examines the worst practices and patterns to come out of the IoC/D-I tools, their limitations, and their communities.  Focusing on Google Guice and others, we examine how and why some of these practices create worse code, and how such errors can be corrected.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Tutorial	2010
20105670	Ten tips every agile team should know about Performance testing	This session covers 10 tips successful agile teams have used to ensure their success. Learn performance anti-patterns like "Too green for his own good" and "Scrooge" and how to spot them before it is too late.  Learn how to prevent problems in the first place using techniques like "Test early, test often" and "Listen to your users" (Yeah, that one is obvious). You will even get to play a fun game that will teach you spot some performance problems like a pro.	Testing/Specification Practices	Tutorial	2010
20105865	Experiences on test planning practices in Agile mode of operation	The presentation describes how the test planning practices have evolved in our large scale organization when moving from the waterfall style software development towards Agile ways of working. \n\nIt discusses the different aspects of the test planning: Which activities are required in the high level release vs. detailed sprint planning? What is the difference between the team level planning vs. planning required across the teams in a large organization? Examples of useful practices are presented as well as experiences on things which have not worked so well. \n\n\n\n\n	Testing/Specification Practices	Experience report	2010
20105841	Turning mountains into molehills: A story of QA 	Dave Haeffner had just changed jobs within his company. Completely shifting his career paradigm from Systems Administration to Quality Assurance. If only he knew the challenges that faced him in the year ahead. He might get excited, or maybe, he would have thought twice.\n\nThere was very little he knew about his new role but that didn't worry him. The mountainous challenges that faced QA is what kept him up at night.\n\nJoin him as he retraces his steps, sharing lessons learned, how he helped change QA from the bottom up, and how he turned those mountainous challenges into molehills.	Testing/Specification Practices	Experience report	2010
20105953	Testing Olympics! Teams Compete to Solve Agile Testing Challenges	Join us for team-based games and compete to solve the agile testing challenges we all face. Do you still have separate "dev"and "test teams"? Mired by mini-waterfalls? Testing at the end of the release? Buried by "manual monkey scripts?"We'll fearlessly tackle these and more in a fun and humorous series of improv sketches, root-cause roundtables, and "what if"scenarios. We'll learn from each other in a friendly competitive environment as teams vote for the best ideas. You'll leave with fresh thinking to resolve or prevent these testing dysfunctions on your agile teams.	Testing/Specification Practices	Workshop	2010
20105496	Why Your Selenium Tests are so Dang Brittle, and What to Do About It	If you are writing automated through-the-GUI tests for a web application, you are in danger of creating tests that are more expensive to maintain than they are worth. With well-factored Selenium RC tests running in Junit or TestNG, you can keep your abstraction layers or "Lingos" -- small bounded bits of slang for discrete parts of the object model -- separate, thereby reducing the maintenance costs of your tests, and improving your sanity. \n\nPrerequisites include experience with Java or C#, and ideally some basic OOD familiarity (inheritance, composition, encapsulation, polymorphism).	Testing/Specification Practices	Tutorial	2010
20105880	The User Feedback Two-Step	One challenge of Agile development is to integrate UX work with the fast iterations of an Agile project. \n\nThe User Feedback Two-Step is a best practice UX team members perform to juggle their work with developers and with end-users. Nimble players can be ready with designed and tested user interfaces when developers need them, and can implement user acceptance testing during iterations. \n\nWe use a simulation game to give participants the experience of working in such a project-both as developers and as UX experts showing how to plan stories and schedule work into coherent iterations. \n	UX/UI	Tutorial	2010
20106058	Agile Transition: How the UX Research Team Did Not Fall Off the Bandwagon	This presentation will cover the evolution of a centralized user experience research team as the engineering organization transitioned from waterfall to an agile development process. The experience report will discuss how a team of three user experience researchers was able to adapt to changes in the development process and how we were able to work with over 10 scrum teams to deliver usability results that impacted the teams' product backlogs.  Concrete examples will also be presented to illustrate how the UX research team was able to evolve with the rest of the engineering organization. 	UX/UI	Experience report	2010
20105773	Making Usability Testing Agile	We all know that testing designs with users is an important step in iterating toward a great product. But using traditional testing methods in a fast-moving agile environment falls short, as our UX team has discovered. To speed things up, we took advantage of resources our company already had - including support staff to recruit users, the customer relationship manager to track participants, and web conference tools to do remote testing. We'll share our failures, successes and challenges as we have modified our methods to be more in sync with our product owners and developers.	UX/UI	Experience report	2010
20106178	Integrating design practices for small agile teams on a budget: You can do it!	You're a small agile dev team with a great idea and a tight budget. You've heard about user research, usability testing, etc., but haven't yet successfully integrated them into your workflow. Your attempts have challenged your budget, your assumptions, and the very agile practices that have served you so well.\nDon't stress. We'll discuss some antipatterns that have emerged, exposing how we can get in our own way in our quest to develop great software. We'll then share a range of core design practices and describe strategies for integrating them into a typical small team's agile workflow.	UX/UI	Talk	2010
20106321	Everything else for the UX Team of One	Whether you're an "innie" or an "outie," we've all had  that  project: The one where there's a lot of "must-dos" but no budget; The one where you have to scope and estimate without requirements; The one where you need to wear about 6 different hats while working on 3 different projects-and it's a project for a client you want to keep.\n\nIn their talk, Michael and Joe will share their experiences managing business development, project management, design and execution, and post-mortems for sole UX practitioners. We'll laugh, we'll cry, we'll share our successes and, er, learning moments.	UX/UI	Talk	2010
20106179	Nano-incremental Development - Elephant Carpaccio	If breaking features down to small tasks is good, what happens if we crank breaking features down to 11? This is a workshop for both product owners and programmers. We will mix into groups of programmers and analysts then every group will be working to implement a small program. Each group will  decompose the problem into initial requests, then the programmers will deliver those features in five 10-minute iterations, with the analyst adjusting requests on the fly. Programming language and environment agnostic, but programmers should bring a laptop with their preferred environment setup.	Team-Room Agile	Workshop	2010
20105200	Agile Mythbusters: Reality over Rhetoric	There are many myths regarding agile software development, such as agile has been adopted by the majority of teams, that agile approaches are more effective, that agile teams don't do up front modeling, that agile teams produce less documentation, that TDD is commonly practiced, and so on. Some of those myths are true, some false, and some we're not so sure about yet.   This talk summarizes the results of 4 years of industry surveys concerning the adoption and effectiveness of agile techniques. Let's cut through the dogma and instead focus on what agile practitioners are actually doing.  	Enterprise Improvement	Talk	2010
20105527	Leading a Self-Organizing Team	One of the challenges of agile is coming to grips with the role of leaders and managers of self-organizing teams. Many go to the extreme of refusing to exert any influence on their teams at all. Others retain too much of a command-and-control style. Leading a self-organizing team can be a fine line. In this session you will learn the proper ways to influence the path taken by a team to solving the problems given to it. You will learn how to become comfortable in this role. You'll understand why influencing a self-organizing team is neither sneaky nor inappropriate but is necessary.	Building High Performance Teams	Tutorial	2010
20105288	What do Agile Executives and Leaders Do?	In some circles agile executives and leaders are admonished to buy pizza and get out of the way. In others they are asked to be supportive of self-organizing teams. But leading agile organizations requires more. There are specific activities that help build agile organizations that can weather business turbulence. This session will explore those activities that an agile leader or executive must "do," including: revising performance measurements; facilitating self-organizing teams; developing strategies for operational, portfolio, and strategic agility; and assessing how agile to be. 	Business Transformation	Tutorial	2010
20105515	Delivering Business Agility: Earning the Agility Dividend 	Agile is spreading into the business world. We know traditional business models and slow moving bureaucratic processes don't work any better for business than the waterfall process works for software development. Award winning CIO and mentor Michael Hugos presents case studies from his own experience illustrating effective use of agile practices to develop new products and redesign business operating procedures. See how companies adopting agile practices earn higher prices for their products and respond effectively to continuous change. (Presentation based on his book - Business Agility) \n\n	Business Transformation	Tutorial	2010
20106277	How to Relate 'Business Value' to Making Money with Agile	One of the central tenants of Agile practices is the emphasis on customer value. That's great, but if you're a product company, focusing on business value alone isn't enough. You need to convert business value into actual money flowing into your company. This workshop will provide a method for relating business value to revenue for major features to be delivered at the end of a release. We will explore themes between a Business Model Framework and a method for Prioritizing Backlogs for Profit to provide attendees with the tools to relate the concepts to their products and services.	Business Transformation	Workshop	2010
20105241	The Big-Ass View on Competence and Communication	Agile team members create their own rules, based on constraints imposed by the environment. But something else is needed for good results: some call it discipline, craftsmanship, or competence. Traffic management teaches us that there are 7 approaches to achieving competence in a self-organizing system. But competence also follows from organizational structure. Organizations are small-world networks, and people are a very diverse bunch of connectors. From network and systems theory we can learn how to use structural patterns to our advantage in growing a competent agile organization.	Organization & Enterprises	Talk	2010
20106306	Introducing Lean Startups: Customer Development Before Product Development	In the world of technology startups, there are winners and losers. Winning startups discover the right product to develop before running out of money.\n\nIn this introduction to Lean Startup theory, Kevin Taylor leverages his experience founding two successful technology companies. We discuss the process of discovering the right product to develop by first discovering the right customers. We examine multiple tools and techniques to iteratively develop customers and determine what their needs are before inexorably committing to a specific product development path or feature set.	Business Transformation	Tutorial	2010
20105625	Institutionalizing Scrum	With its growing popularity, Scrum is being applied in a number of large and complex organizations. Many of these face challenges leading to the situation where Scrum faces the temptation of "institutionalization". It is changed, tempered, or adjusted. Perhaps as a temporary measure, or simply to align Scrum with other processes, or as an adjustment for the circumstance. What are the trade-offs when Scrum, a trans-formative process becomes part of the institution? Join to facilitators who will argue the pros and cons of this situation and invite the audience to participate in the discussion.	Project Management	Other	2010
20106137	Turning Horses into Zebras:  A firsthand account of an Agile transformation	Witness firsthand accounts from the front lines of a successful Agile transformation. \n\nIn 2009, Gap Inc Direct, the online division of Gap, Inc. made a commitment to extend their Agile software delivery practices to their Columbus, Ohio development campus where teams provide solutions for online order fulfillment and call center operations.\n\nLearn the hidden truths, best practices, and lessons learned from "going Agile"as you join us on our journey in transitioning from a traditional waterfall approach to high performing Agile teams in a matter of months.\n	Enterprise Improvement	Tutorial	2010
20106333	Kanban Explained: Seeing, Not Hearing Constraints	Seeing constraints, pulling value and eliminating waste is the goal of practicing kanban. This session is for those who are not familiar with this practice. In addition to understanding how to implement kanban, we will also discuss cross team signals, team signals & retrospective boards.  I will use physical boards to illustrate the concepts.\n\nIntended audience is for those who want to learn more about pull based practices, continuous flow and self organization.  Maintaining flow is the goal, while allowing time to deliver AND allowing time for continuous improvement at a sustainable pace.\n	Enterprise Improvement	Talk	2010
20105646	Case Study: Successful Agile Transformation at Gale - We Burnt the Boats	By any standard, the ongoing year-long, multi-team agile transformation at Gale is an enormous success. We have gone from average project durations of 18 months to average durations of 6 months. Production releases had hundreds of defects before we began, and now have handfuls. We are earning ROI on our software products far faster, while we garner awards for innovation and user value. Come hear how we did it: our challenges, our successes, our setbacks, our wins and losses. Come hear how Big Bang "Enterprise Agile Tranformation"is alive and kicking, fully backed now by our CEO.\n\n	Enterprise Improvement	Tutorial	2010
20105375	Value over Velocity: From Feature Building to Value Delivery	Introducing an approach to defining and measuring business value that is simple, intuitive and built on 30 years of success. Forget user stories, points, velocity and all the typical agile terms associated with business value. Instead, learn how to clearly quantify business objectives and measure value delivered through a combination of lecture and hands-on exercises.\n\nThe approach combines the principles of Evo with the practices of Scrum to enable teams to clearly define and report the value they've delivered each  release to stakeholders in terms they've defined!\n	Expressing User Needs	Talk	2010
20106354	Decoupled Requirements Pipeline	A story should not exit an iteration until it is done, but to be done at the end of an iteration, it must be ready at iteration start!\n\nBut typical agile processes often defer detailed requirements discussions and elaboration until Iteration Planning, or to the prior iteration.  This JIT approach works well for many, but often fails in complex scenarios.  \n\nA new requirements approach is needed for complex projects; this session will cover how to mature requirements in a decoupled pipeline, operating on a separate cadence from the development iterations.	Expressing User Needs	Talk	2010
20105226	Agile business analysis	This session will bring together a set of practices to help analysts support agile teams.\n\nWhere analysts sit between the business and developers they can reduce collaboration, delay information arrival and mis-direct. An agile business analyst by contrast is an enabler and facilitator.\n\nThe analyst must work with business stakeholders and the development team to ensure that information is available at the right time and fidelity. Information arriving too early can be wasteful due to depreciation while information arriving late increases the risk of re-work.\n\n	Expressing User Needs	Workshop	2010
20105210	Beyond User Stories: Identifying and Defining Missing Links in Your Product Back	How comprehensive is your backlog?  Does it include nonfunctional requirements?  These are often 'missing links' in a product backlog. A holistic set of product requirements includes quality attributes, external interfaces, and design & implementation constraints. Some nonfunctional requirements don't easily fit into the user story canonical format. We will survey practical techniques for agile teams to represent nonfunctional requirements and provide practice with a sampling of the techniques so you can understand how nonfunctional requirements are vital link in your backlog.	Expressing User Needs	Tutorial	2010
20106014	How to Own a Really Big Complex Product	Product Owner is the most misunderstood and misapplied role in Scrum. The concept barely works on small products... it almost always fails in larger enterprises where many teams work together on complex enterprise deliverables.  We hear about people implementing product councils and product owner teams but that seems to miss the point of having single wring-able neck. This talk explores the role of Product Owner and breaks down just what it takes to do this role well. We'll explore a capability driven model for scaling the PO role and keeping us all focused on building the right products.  	Product Management	Talk	2010
20106006	Agile in the Real World	In its pure form, Agile is a simple theory -- a prioritized backlog, iterations, collaboration, scrums, etc. Practicing it in its pure form in the real world of enterprise software is challenging. There are many other business demands that affect how we practice Agile software development. These constrain and increase the responsibilities of the scrum team and affect velocity as well as how and when software can be released. This necessitates proper planning in recognizing these realities up-front.	Product Management	Talk	2010
20105531	Agile Inception: Approving Agile Projects in a Waterfall World	Whether you're working on a new development effort or the next release of an existing system you need to get your project approved. Many organizations have embraced agile but still follow a traditional project-approval process requiring a complete, up-front project plan including dates, costs, and resources. This tutorial focuses on strategies for overcoming this disconnect of "build in an agile way but still provide all of the same waterfall-like artifacts to get your project approved."	Product Management	Tutorial	2010
20106120	Bringing Agility to the PO Team - Scaling or Failing in an Enterprise Transition	In enterprise situations we have a more complex upstream than a single Product Owner, but rather a Product Owner Team. But a bad PO team can sink an Agile transition.\n\nIn this session we will talk about how we can bring Agile practices and tools to the upstream processes and how they can help us achieve better agility and visibility outside the development team. .\n\nWe will explore how POs and Agile Project Managers can use Kanban, Retrospectives and other agile tools and practices to build better PO Teams. We will look at metrics and visibility tools, and discuss flow in these processes.	Product Management	Tutorial	2010
20106307	Save 76% - Joys and Pitfalls of using Virtual Worlds for Remote Teams	Travel budgets are under pressure.  Traditional 2d collaboration tools help, but may not engage our minds or convey as much information as 3d virtual worlds.  Many companies, universities, and government bodies are using virtual worlds for collaboration.  But what are the pitfalls? This talk shows how 3d tools were used to save 76% of event costs, as well as how to conduct Scrum in 3d.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20106123	How an Agile Project can Fail; and what to do about it.	This experience report is about how "agile"projects that are poorly implemented can turn into a worse nightmare than old traditional projects. This fixed-price project had lots of customer feedback and changes. Scope creep was evident but "Agile says be open to feedback."The project started losing lots of money and it was barely halfway done. The project illustrates a great account of how literal and immature implementations of Agile may lead a project to failure and how management can turn things around by the proper adoption of agile practices.	Project Management	Experience report	2010
20105794	Estimation Games - Play to create and destroy good estimates	Estimation is associated with Fear, Uncertainty and Deathmarches. Most of us would rather not estimate. Yet, sometimes we do need estimates and commitments, even on "estimation-less" projects.\n\nPlay a series of estimation games to experience how different techniques deliver very different results. Learn a few simple rules that turn you into a reliable estimator.\n\nBut correct estimates aren't enough. See what else is required to deliver on your promises. Learn to deal with the destructive games people play with estimates.\n\nEstimating can be Fun, embracing Uncertainty and Delivering.	Project Management	Tutorial	2010
20105674	Agile Projects - Beginning with the End in Mind	Too often teams simply dive into Agile projects-allowing the iterative and emergent nature of agility to guide\nthem through the project. Sometimes this works well, often it can fail because you're not well "Connected"to the\n "Business". This sessions examines how to consistently get your Agile projects off to a strong beginning. We'll explore how to create a project charter to guide your agile project; the keys to forming a solid agile team; and how to create a plan that allows your stakeholders to understand where you're going.\n\n	Project Management	Workshop	2010
20106365	PDCA: Moving Beyond Simple Inspect and Adapt	Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) is a Lean discipline that moves beyond inspect and adapt of Agile team-level processes. At a corporate level, PDCA provides guidance for strategy as well as problem-solving work. In 2009, I led Rally's move to PDCA for the company's strategy process at both the annual and quarterly levels. My primary guide was Pascal Dennis's "Getting the Right Things Done". In this experience report, I share Rally's PDCA first year of adoption: where we started, how this impacted our corporate behaviors, and where we are now.

20106213	Unleash the Agile power: bridge the Gap between Development and Operations.	Enterprises traditionally distinct Development focusing on the creation of software and Operations focusing on the infrastructure. A natural gap between the two is caused by their key interest: change versus stability. \n\nIntroducing Agile in Development confronts Operations with more work due to increased productivity and release frequencies. The power of Agile is not unleashed. \n\nA case study at KLM/Air France shows how this impediment was overcome and huge savings were achieved by implementing a self-service change control process for Development still under full control of Operations.	Organization & Enterprises	Experience report	2010
20105685	Distributed ScrumMasters & The Art of Digital Facilitation	ScrumMasters for distributed teams need help.\n\nAs more corporations offshore/nearshore their development efforts, ScrumMasters bear the burden of facilitating distributed Scrum or Agile without being prepared for its unique challenges. While ScrumMaster Certifications and local user groups do provide guidance, they are often focused on collocated scenarios. \n\nIn this talk, I will convey my personal experiences of being a ScrumMaster for geographically distributed teams and explain what steps you can take to be successful.\n	Adoption	Talk	2010
20105728	Look before you leap - Agile readiness assessments done right	A common approach to help get clients started with Agile is to undertake a readiness assessment to:  \n1. Understand challenges and goals  \n2. Understand the environment and technical practices  \n3. Decide what techniques (Scrum, Kanban, collocation, etc) might be suitable  \n4. Build a plan with them of what a transition to Agile might look like  \n\nUnfortunately there is very little written about how to go about this. Hence, this knowledge-sharing workshop to define this better.\n\nThe workshop involves active participation so come ready to share your experiences and learn from others.	Adoption	Workshop	2010
20106055	Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both	There's a lot of buzz on Kanban right now in the agile software development community. Since Scrum has become quite mainstream now, a common question is "so what is Kanban, and how does it compare to Scrum?" Where do they complement each other? Are there any potential conflicts? Can an organization combine these techniques?\n\nThe purpose of this session is to clarify Kanban and Scrum by comparing them, so you can figure out how these may come to use in your environment. \n\nBased on the book Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both.	Adoption	Talk	2010
20105640	Continuous Creativity for Agile Teams	Creativity can manifest in several ways including creation of something new, refinement of something that exists and problem solving. How do we support, enable and enhance the creative abilities of Agile teams? There are many ways to shape the work environment for greater creativity. We will present a summary of the literature that describes how creativity can be enhanced by providing a safe, nurturing environment, enhancing group interactions, pacing activities that utilize different sensory modes and trusting in the power of subconscious integration.\n	Building High Performance Teams	Talk	2010
20105112	Project Vital Signs	In order to foster trust and credibility between a project team and its stakeholders, the team has the responsibility to clearly communicate the health of the project. As the leaders of a project, we can apply the metaphor of medical care and their use of "vital signs" to help form a holistic view of the state of the project. Come learn the five "Project Vital Signs", their associated quantitative metrics and how to enable a team to effectively use them as a tool to diagnose and treat project health problems.	Project Management	Talk	2010
20105946	The team manifesto	Since 1998, I have been a member and leader of volunteer teams. For self-organised and self-motivated teams, agreeing on a mission statement, a 'code of conduct' and a shared mindset and values are indispensable to succeed. \nTeam collaboration is at the heart of agile, and I found the skills I acquired as a volunteer invaluable in my daily work life. What can we learn from techniques successfully used by volunteer teams? In this workshop, I will introduce team building tools and discuss how a cross-disciplinary 'team manifesto' can improve collaboration, satisfaction and quality. 	Building High Performance Teams	Workshop	2010
20106397	Your Team, Your Freedom, Your Responsibility	"OK, find a partner." In high school, did that phrase fill you with dread? And yet here we are bragging about our self-organizing agile teams: high-performing, highly-collaborative, and fun. The basics of the self-organizing team are easily accepted: the team that does the work says how big it is and decides how to get it done.  The harder part is that with that freedom comes responsibility.  Only by accepting responsibility do we turn the engine on for real.  What are those responsibilities?  Transparency, Commitment, and Courage	Building High Performance Teams	Workshop	2010
20105385	Coaching Introverts: Building on Their Quiet Strengths	In an Agile workplace it certainly seems that extroverts have the run of the roost. It's loud. It's interaction-intensive. It's focused on rapid results.  The introverts on your team can end up feeling excluded, overlooked, or simply misunderstood.\n\nWhat's a coach to do?\n\nThis session explores how knowledge of Myers-Briggs personality types can help you decipher the interactions & friction within your team. Building on Jennifer Kahnweiler's Four Ps we'll delve into ways to bring out the inherent leadership potential of the introverted agilista to make their voices heard.\n	Coaching Agile	Tutorial	2010
20105965	Developing ScrumMaster Excellence	At salesforce.com the ScrumMaster role is filled by Development Managers, QA Managers, Program Managers, and individual contributors. Because of these dual roles and differences in background, it is common for people to be confused about the expectations of a ScrumMaster. To increase ScrumMaster effectiveness and help the organization distinguish great ScrumMasters from good ScrumMasters, salesforce.com developed a ScrumMaster competency model.  In this session we'll present the competencies, discuss how they were created, and how they are used.	Coaching Agile	Talk	2010
20105679	The Limited Red Society	When you have compilation errors and/or failing tests, you are "in the red", unable to integrate or release your code. Over the years, I've learned techniques to limit red time while test-driving and refactoring code. In this talk, we will study live Eclipse/Java programming sessions using graphs that clearly visualize red time and green time. You'll learn strategies and tactics that help or hurt our ability to limit red time and you'll gain an appreciation for the visual cues that can help make you a better programmer and fellow member of the Limited Red Society.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Talk	2010
20106251	The Curious, Present and Empathetic Agile Coach	Have you ever had clients who "just don't get it"? who are unwilling to change, and with whom you become frustrated over their inability to embrace Agile practices?  Do you find your advice is ignored or altered so significantly that the end result no longer seems to represent the foundational Agile values and principles?  In this session you'll discover a set of beliefs, attitudes and behaviors that are designed to help Agile coaches remain grounded in their convictions while also being curious, empathetic and adaptive to their client's toughest circumstances.	Coaching Agile	Workshop	2010
20105365	Learn how to accomplish more with the Quadrants of Effectiveness Game	You know which agile practices will move your business forward. However, there's no time to actually make it all happen. Whether you're introducing agile practices, you're a customer aching for new features, you're trying to keep your clients happy or you just want to get some work done, The Eisenhower Method (from Covey's "7 Habits of Highly Effective People"? is a simple yet powerful technique to become more effective and getting the right things done at the right time.\n\nJoin us for the Quadrants of Effectiveness board game to learn and practice this method. Fun guaranteed! 	Leadership & Culture	Workshop	2010
20105713	Manager as Work System Designer: 13 Essential Questions 	Its 60 years since Deming said that the biggest problem with many companies is management that is off course. Despite recent interest in applying Lean concepts to software, not enough has changed.  \n\nWhy?\n\nWe think of managers making decisions, setting priorities, organizing work, keeping budgets, hiring, and mentoring people. What we've overlooked is a manager's role as designer. Managers are designers of the experience of work and of systems to produce valuable products.\n\nAs designers, we need to ask and answer questions that will help us create those experiences and systems. 	Leadership & Culture	Talk	2010
20105799	Tackle Culture or Face Failure	Are you thinking about trying agile approaches? Do you have a transition underway? Is your team or organization trying to become agile, but been less than successful thus far? A foundational implication - and biggest potential roadblock - of the agile manifesto is culture change.  \n\nTo be successful with agile and especially to scale, you must go beyond technical practices and simultaneously tackle culture changes. This session shows why this is so, introducing an easy culture model and providing you the opportunity to try out two culture tools to help you plan and overcome hurdles.	Leadership & Culture	Tutorial	2010
20106086	Leading Individuals and Teams with Situational Leadership	Individual and team performance varies by the competence and commitment with the task at hand.  Leaders must be adept at diagnosing situations and versatile in applying the matching leadership style to improve the individual's or team's performance.  Leaders at all levels (functional leads, scrum masters, agile coaches, managers, etc.) will walk away from this engaging workshop with knowledge and skills that will improve their leadership versatility and overall effectiveness regardless of the situation.  This workshop is based on the Situational Leadership II model developed by Ken Blanchard.	Leadership & Culture	Workshop	2010
20105218	Using Scrum to avoid bad CMMI implementations	Scrum and CMMI are often at odds with each other. Scrum focuses on the most important product issues first and supports frequent communication. CMMI promotes consistency and discipline to avoid waste and rework. This experience report covers three Agile CMMI organizations that have used Scrum with CMMI to obtain the best of both worlds. The first organization is an initial Scrum and CMMI implementation, the second organization is using CMMI to bring a failed Scrum implementation back to life, and the third organization is one of the only CMMI Level 5 Scrum implementations in the world.

20105782	Enterprise Scrum: Creating an Agile Company	Enterprise Scrum, a fractal extension of Scrum and XP, has organized all development at Citrix Online since Jan 2009. We estimate team months, run quarterly Sprints, reassign teams, meet in weekly stand-ups. We start or postpone whole projects that use Scrum or Scrum-of-Scrums.\n\nNo other known companies yet use Enterprise Scrum. It provides extreme visibility and control for CXOs. It promotes agile thinking enterprise-wide, driving adoption outside engineering. It demands NPV justification and forces executives to prioritize decisions transparently. It makes us more profitable.	Organization & Enterprises	Talk	2010
20106147	Extending Agile - to finance (really?)	At Progressive Medical Inc (PMI) Value Stories are one of the most innovative aspects of our transformation.  Essentially a Value Story covers how what we are building will make or save money.\n\nA guiding principle of our projects is working on the items that create the most value first. Value stories enable us to have an enterprise view of where value is created (crossing multiple functional boundaries)\n\nWe were already formalizing our ROI process, now we have fairly granular Value Stories, with a numerical ROI, that are used to prioritize work within large multi-stakeholder initiatives.	Organization & Enterprises	Workshop	2010
20106273	Agile and the Federal Government - A Panel Discussion	The Agile Manifesto states interactions over processes, collaboration over contracts, working software over documentation, and responding to change over following a plan.  These base principals seem to be diametrically opposed to the Federal government.  Is Agile appropriate for the Federal government and is the government ready for Agile?  This panel discussion will look to address this question while taking a deep dive into the value, issues, details, and vision for Agile in the Federal government.	Organization & Enterprises	Panel	2010
20105739	Managing Growth Pains on the Way to 40 Scrum Teams	What do four global enterprises, each with 40+ Scrum teams of 5-9 people have in common? For the most part they are no different than a project with just one Scrum team. This session will show the size-dependent problems that arose in these projects and how the practices of Multi-stage Continuous Integration, small story size, collocation, cross functional teams, one piece flow, and unit tests helped to address them. Even if you don't have many Scrum teams today, learning about the growing pains will help you fine tune what you are doing today and prepare for growth tomorrow.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Tutorial	2010
20105291	Why you suck at offshoring...even with Agile	Offshore is never easy, but more often than not, the secret saboteur isn't someone in far off timezone, it's you and your team. \n\nThis working session will examine offshore work from the perspective of an offshore team lead who deals with onshore resources that often enable the failure of their offshore teams. The workshop will address issues commonly faced by teams working with offshore and what onshore teams can do to foster better results. Towards the second half of the session the discussion will be opened up for participants to introduce issues and develop solutions as a group. 	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Workshop	2010
20105765	Technically Distributed - Tools and Technology for Distributed Teams	When agile methods are adopted in enterprise organizations there are often members or teams which are not collocated, or work is segregated among distributed teams. While this is often a challenge for things like technical practices (for example, pair programming) it has an even greater impact on the psychology of the team in how they interact and learn. In this session Cory will demonstrate tools and practices he's coached. These tools and practices cover three high-level categories: Development Practices, Product Management / Customer Interaction and Reflection and Introspection.	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Demonstration	2010
20106009	Product Ownership in the Large	Most Agile practices target teams of 7Â±2. A Scrum of Scrums addresses teams of (7Â±2)Â², or 25 to 81.  What do you do when you run a project on the scale of 7Â³ (~350) or 7^4 ( ~2400) contributors?  It's no longer a Scrum of Scrums of Scrums of Scrums.\n\nI've been in the role of product owner for extended teams of 400=2400 at Microsoft. Building on my Agile 2009 talk, Agile in the Very Large, I'll discuss techniques for envisioning, planning, executing, and releasing product in an organization of this scale, while maintaining empowerment and agile at the individual team scale of 7Â±2.\n	Large Scale & Distributed Agile	Talk	2010
20105905	How long would a Stand-Up meeting take with 85 people in it?	If an 8 person standup takes 20 minutes, a logical assumption is that 85 people could take nearly 3 hours. But what if that wasn't true? At Menlo a daily standup with 85 people typically completes in 15 mins. What other beliefs might be wrong? What if you delivered an installable CD every week? If you collocate many projects together? If everyone had storycards? If sponsors had to move index cards to authorize work? If devs, designers, and QA pair full time? If you eliminate email & meetings? Join us for hands-on exercises and learn why logical assumptions about agile might just not be true.	Team-Room Agile	Tutorial	2010
20105133	Confessions of a Flow Junkie	Vehicular traffic, grocery store lines, and even making dinner in your kitchen all need require Flow in order to work effectively. In software projects Flow is equally important and the same dire consequences result when disruption occurs. The fact is that Flow is a core concept behind all Agile approaches, and needs to be maximized at several levels.\n\nThis interactive talk combines tongue-in-cheek humour with real-world examples of how maximizing flow will help you deliver software sooner and better, as well as shine a light on impediments to flow that you may not have considered before!	Team-Room Agile	Talk	2010
20105201	Agile Modeling and Documentation Practices	This presentation explores the differences between traditional and agile approaches to modeling and documentation.  It explores what it means for a model to be agile.  It describes practices from Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) such as requirements envisioning, architecture envisioning, executable specifications, document late, model storming, and single sourcing information.  Industry statistics around how much modeling and documentation occurs on agile projects, and the effectiveness thereof, will be presented to address some of the misconceptions people may have about this subject.	Team-Room Agile	Talk	2010
20105183	Hitting the Wall: What to Do When High Performing Scrum Overwhelms Operations	All-at-once Scrum implementations require total commitment to change, high level management participation and aggressive removal of impediments. In July of 2009, Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA)  deployed 27 Scrum teams in the U.S. and India in less than two months and global continuous integration became a top priority impediment.  To avoid "hitting the wall"before the first major Scrum release of their enterprise software applications, a Scrum SWAT team engineered a continuous integration environment for hundreds of software developers on two continents within a few weeks.\n	Team-Room Agile	Talk	2010
20105189	Your software can run faster	This tutorial gets you started in performance engineering.\n\nEveryone likes systems that are 'fast', but 'fast' won't do as a metric. The many facets of 'fast' are discussed, but throughput is the main focus of the tutorial.\n\nIn order to improve throughput, the current bottleneck resource must be found and used more efficiently. This procedure is followed iteratively and recursively until it becomes uneconomic to do so. \n\nBottlenecks are identified by monitoring resource utilization. To make this practical, performance tests must be automated, mirroring modern unit test practices.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Tutorial	2010
20106308	Behaviour driven infrastructure with cucumber-nagios	Setting up monitoring can be complicated - tests tend to lack expressiveness and robustness, and quite often don't even test the right problem in the first place.\n\ncucumber-nagios aims to alleviate these problems by providing a standard library of checks that can easily be reused across websites and Unix infrastructure. These checks also happen to be written in plain English.\n\nLindsay Holmwood will be covering how to start using cucumber-nagios, writing tests for your infrastructure, and why it's important to test the behaviour (and not just the availability) of your production apps.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Demonstration	2010
20106093	The Worst of Legacy Code: Forensic Development	This session will teach 2 techniques that not only individually help to tackle the more complex parts of legacy code, but combined act as the most powerful technique to fix the worst legacy code situations.\nAfter exploring these separately, we will dive into how they work together to improve a hideous piece of legacy code. It is in Russian, with no access to the underlying source objects, and can't be instantiated (due to external dependencies). \n\nIf firefighting or legacy code is part of your job, this is one session not to be missed	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Demonstration	2010
20105125	Large-scale refactorings using the Mikado Method	For any code base, ill- or well-structured, there comes a time when you want to change large portions of it to meet new functional requirements or a new business model. When these changes become extensive, it's easy to get lost in a jungle of dependencies, or on a sea of broken code.  \n\nThis session presents 'The Mikado Method', a systematic approach to large changes. It helps you visualize, prepare and perform business-value-focused refactorings, without having a broken code-base. It also enhances communication, collaboration, learning for teams and helps individuals stay on track.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Workshop	2010
20105897	Executable Specifications and Domain Specific Languages for Software Teams	Many agile projects strive to automate their acceptance tests, but rarely achieve the automation they desire.  Recent advances in the use of Domain Specific Languages (DSL), testing frameworks like Cucumber, Fitnesse, RSpec and languages like Ruby and Scala provide a rich set of tools to effectively automate customer acceptance tests. This tutorial will leverage actual project examples on how to effectiveley to use Cucumber, Fitnesse, RSpec, Selenium, Ruby and Scala to create human readable, executable user story specifications. 	Testing/Specification Practices	Tutorial	2010
20105295	Story Testing and the 3 Amigos - an experience report	We are actively writing story tests first as 3 amigos (business, dev, & qa).  The team was struggling with some "accordian effect"of a batch of stories in building and then a week later a batch in verify.  Defects were being found late and often due to misinterpretation of requirements.  And we had features that were going to be difficult for GUI automation.  We will talk about how the 3 amigos were done and how they helped.  We will talk about the specifics of the tests written and their impact on design.   And we'll also discuss hiccups along the way and things to still work on.	Testing/Specification Practices	Experience report	2010
20106081	Iterative Performance Testing	Performance testing can be a challenge in Agile development. On a large scale Gap program, we applied some strategies to ensure high availability and performance that exceeds the business expectation. We used an iterative approach, starting with a basic test of the first working code base. That became the baseline that we built upon, by adding more complex and realistic test scenarios as new features were built. In addition we included soak and load tests in the baseline suite.\nAnother iterative approach we applied is to find the breaking point for the system and how it changes over time.	Testing/Specification Practices	Experience report	2010
20105652	Agile Test Case Management	'...over comprehensive documentation' is sometimes interpreted as 'no documentation' but that can be somewhat reckless. There are good reasons for documenting your test cases and their execution. This session looks at some lightweight, dare I say, Agile ways of managing your test cases including mindmaps, checklists and wikis.	Testing/Specification Practices	Workshop	2010
20106278	Non-Functional Requirements, Agile Style	Agile teams typically apply user stories to capture functional requirements - the "what" the system will do. However, agile literature and practice provides little or no guidance on establishing "how well"? in aggregate, the system performs those functions. This tutorial introduces simple, proven practices for defining and testing nonfunctional requirements (aka system qualities) including integration into your agile processes. You will learn how to define and quantify the right system qualities so everyone understands the system's expected performance.	Testing/Specification Practices	Tutorial	2010
20105524	Getting Started with User Research	The gap between a good product and a great one can be bridged by understanding your users.\n\nIn this session you will learn how better systems are built by taking small, iterative steps to understand the users desires, needs and abilities.\n\nYou will learn how to get information about users quickly and cheaply. For those that have more time (and perhaps a small budget) Carol will introduce methods you can use to get more detailed information from your users.  You will also learn ways to effectively share and communicate this information.  \n	UX/UI	Tutorial	2010
20105182	Beyond Staggered Sprints: Agile user experience design teams in the real world.	When integrating design teams within an Agile framework, the general practice is one of staggered sprints - keep the design team at least one sprint ahead of the dev team to ensure smooth transitions from sprint to sprint.\n\nOnce put into practice however, the division of labor is never that clean. This presentation will cover how TheLadders.com product, technology and user experience teams successfully integrated an Agile framework into their process and evolved the "staggered sprints"concept into a more holistic approach to UX/Agile success. \n	UX/UI	Talk	2010
20106465	Agile UX planning	Previously, I've written about adapting usability investigation methods for agile, and talked about keeping the big picture in mind without Big Design. This talk is about how the UX team at Autodesk used agile methods to plan design. In other words, this talk will connect parallel track design as we practice it to our agile planning board.	UX/UI	Talk	2010
20106433	Prototyping with Junk	This session gives participants an additional tool to use in an early sprint for a product, a feature or set of features. Participants will use physical materials which are typically not thought of as part of the business setting - a.k.a. "junk."  This session will be divided 4 segments:  \n1) Creating prototypes in small groups  \n2) Reflecting on the prototypes, their purpose(s) and the assumptions behind them  \n3) Revising prototypes based on the reflection \n4) Finally, we'll summarize what we've learned, and how to incorporate this exercise or similar ones into the work of Agile teams.	UX/UI	Workshop	2010
20105296	Lean in a Nutshell	Join Mary Poppendieck for a Lean in a Nutshell - a fast-paced talk aimed at senior developers and team leads. The lecture and discussion will focus on framing the software development process; it will cover four key frames that really make a difference when you are developing software: (1) A systems view, (2) Essential technical capability, (3) What it takes to deliver reliably, and (4) How to improve. \n	Enterprise Improvement	Tutorial	2010
20105328	Refactor Your Retrospectives	Effective retrospectives enable a team to improve iteratively. However, as Agile team leaders and ScrumMasters know from experience, retrospectives can be challenging to facilitate and engage their team in.\n\nCome to this tutorial to find out about retrospective smells to avoid. Learn how you can refactor your retrospectives so they become something the team looks forward to rather than dreads. Embed retrospectives deeper into the way your team works by extending other tried and tested agile practices to your retrospectives.	Building High Performance Teams	Tutorial	2010
20106157	Products over Process: Successfully Blending Agile Methods and Design Thinking	Several years ago, two agilists (your humble hosts) met and started sharing experiences using agile methods to produce products and their frustrations when "being Agile" was more valued than meeting users needs. Our session draws on our shared experiences blending design thinking (e.g. user centered design) and agile methods to discover and deliver meaningful products. We will cover product design, pragmatic personas,  customer discover, story mapping and story telling and more as we teach techniques and share experiences using agility to produce products validated with real user communities.	Business Transformation	Tutorial	2010
20106298	Understanding Design Complexity	Domain driven design isn't enough to prevent churn on complex, hairy systems. To get slightly ahead of the design curve you should understand more about the inherent complexities in the domain. This tutorial introduces two techniques designers and domain experts can use in conversations to reveal complexities, variations, and stable concepts: commonality-variability analysis and hot spot cards. Applying these techniques allows designers to see the slightly bigger picture so they can be better equipped to align their solutions with the relatively stable parts and support known variations.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Tutorial	2010
20106177	Coupling Loosely	Mock objects are a good way to break apart a legacy system to test it. However, they do not improve coupling (few dependencies between units) or cohesion (each unit does one thing). Developers who rely on mocks build well-tested legacy code, even on greenfield projects.\n\nThe next step, making the code easy to change, requires using indirections with looser coupling. In this information-dense, code-oriented session, we'll learn 12 to 18 key indirections and their impacts on your design. Next time, choose the right indirection for the job rather than just reaching for another mock object.	Technical Edge-Development Praxis	Talk	2010
20106181	Telling Your Exploratory Story	Exploratory testing is an approach emphasizing freedom and creativity. For projects that use Agile values and principles, there are two areas where exploration might be particularly useful -- story creation and feature integration. The first may involve a brainstorm using heuristics that trigger ideas about structure, functions, data, platform, operations, and time (to name a few). Feature integration can benefit from chartered, time-boxed sessions where structured exploration exposes new risks and vulnerabilities. This talk is about methods to describe the thoughtful testing of those stories.	Testing/Specification Practices	Talk	2010
